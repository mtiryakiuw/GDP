\noindent\textbf{Summary}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{justify}
This thesis examines the determinants of gender wage gaps across European labor markets using advanced panel data methods. It analyzes harmonized Structure of Earnings Survey data from 40 countries spanning 2010-2022, including 14,725 panel observations from 5,248 unique country-sector-occupation combinations across 18 detailed NACE Rev. 2 sectors. The study reveals substantial sectoral heterogeneity: Industry sectors exhibit gender pay gaps 3.582 percentage points larger than public sectors, while Public sector employment demonstrates the reference baseline with narrowest gaps. Notably, sector-occupation interactions demonstrate complex patterns—high-skill workers in Industry face 3.357 percentage points narrower gaps than additive effects predict, while Public sector managers experience 5.451 percentage points lower gaps. Temporal analysis documents consistent convergence, with gaps declining 2.672 percentage points from 2010 to 2022. The findings emphasize that wage discrimination operates through nuanced interactions between sectoral institutions and occupational hierarchies, requiring multidimensional policy interventions.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Gender pay gaps represent one of the most persistent forms of labor market inequality across European economies, with women earning approximately 12\% less than men for comparable work despite extensive equality legislation \cite{eurostat2023}. This differential extends beyond individual economic consequences to generate substantial implications for household financial security, retirement adequacy, and macroeconomic productivity across European Union member states.

The persistence of gender wage differentials presents a compelling analytical puzzle for labor economists. While aggregate measures document the magnitude of inequality, they obscure significant heterogeneity in how gender pay gaps manifest across economic sectors and occupational hierarchies. Understanding these variations proves essential for developing targeted policy interventions that address specific mechanisms perpetuating workplace inequality in diverse institutional contexts.

This research examines the determinants of the gender pay gap across European labor markets through a systematic analysis of sectoral and occupational factors using comprehensive panel data from the Structure of Earnings Survey, spanning the period from 2010 to 2022. The study addresses critical gaps in cross-sectoral gender wage research while providing policy-relevant insights for European labor market equality initiatives.

This thesis addresses three specific research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{RQ1:} How do sectoral institutional arrangements affect gender wage gaps across 18 detailed NACE Rev. 2 economic sectors, and do certain sectors exhibit negative gaps where women out-earn men?
\item \textbf{RQ2:} To what extent does occupational hierarchy (high-skill positions and managerial roles) moderate sectoral wage discrimination patterns?
\item \textbf{RQ3:} Is there evidence of beta convergence in gender wage gaps across European countries, where countries with higher initial gaps experience faster subsequent reductions?
\end{enumerate}

The analytical scope encompasses 40 European countries across 18 detailed NACE Rev. 2 economic sectors and nine ISCO-08 occupational categories. This framework enables the investigation of both institutional sectoral effects and organizational hierarchy influences on gender compensation differentials. The temporal coverage captures significant institutional developments, including the aftermath of the financial crisis, the evolution of gender equality legislation, and the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on labor markets.

\subsection{Thesis Structure}

This thesis is organized into six main sections that systematically build the analytical framework and present empirical findings. \textbf{Section I (Introduction)} establishes the research problem, motivates the study's significance, and outlines the analytical scope across 40 European countries and 18 economic sectors from 2010-2022. \textbf{Section II (Literature Review)} synthesizes nine interconnected themes: theoretical foundations of wage discrimination, empirical evidence on sectoral variations, mechanisms of occupational segregation, cross-national institutional factors, intersectional perspectives, policy interventions, methodological advances, pandemic-era labor market developments, and identification of research gaps that this study addresses. \textbf{Section III (Research Questions)} explicitly formulates three fundamental research questions regarding sectoral heterogeneity, occupational hierarchy moderation, and cross-national institutional variations, along with three main hypotheses (H1: Sectoral Determinants, H2: Occupational Determinants, H3: Institutional Determinants and Convergence) derived from institutional theory and welfare state research. \textbf{Section IV (Data)} describes the Structure of Earnings Survey data source, variable construction methodology, sectoral and occupational classification rationale, welfare regime typology, data cleaning procedures, and panel structure, ensuring transparency and replicability. \textbf{Section V (Methodological Design)} presents the panel data econometric framework, estimator selection criteria, robust inference strategies addressing serial correlation and heteroskedasticity, identification approaches for endogeneity concerns, and model specifications testing each hypothesis through sectoral disaggregation, sector-occupation interactions, country group analysis, and beta convergence dynamics. \textbf{Section VI (Results)} reports descriptive statistics, panel regression estimates, hypothesis testing outcomes, heterogeneous treatment effects from interaction analyses, institutional moderation patterns, temporal convergence dynamics, and robustness checks across alternative specifications. \textbf{Section VII (Conclusion)} synthesizes principal findings, discusses theoretical and policy implications, acknowledges methodological limitations, and proposes future research directions for advancing gender wage equality in European labor markets.

These findings contribute to a theoretical understanding of labor market inequality mechanisms and support evidence-based policy approaches to promoting workplace equality. The sectoral analysis informs industry-specific interventions, while the findings on occupational hierarchy guide organizational policies aimed at promoting career advancement and compensation transparency across European contexts.

\section{LITERATURE REVIEW}

The gender wage gap remains one of the most persistent labor market inequalities across developed economies, with substantial variation across sectors, occupations, and institutional contexts. This literature review synthesizes theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence on gender pay differentials, with particular emphasis on sectoral and occupational determinants within European labor markets. The review proceeds through nine interconnected themes: theoretical foundations of wage discrimination, empirical evidence on sectoral variations, mechanisms of occupational segregation, cross-national institutional factors, intersectional perspectives, policy interventions and evaluations, methodological advances in panel data analysis, recent evidence from pandemic-era labor markets, and the identification of research gaps.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundations of Gender Wage Discrimination}

The economic analysis of gender wage differentials draws upon three primary theoretical frameworks that provide complementary explanations for persistent compensation inequalities. Human capital theory, pioneered by \cite{becker1964} and \cite{mincer1974}, suggests that wage differences reflect productivity differentials arising from investments in education, training, and work experience. Within this framework, gender wage gaps emerge from systematic differences in human capital accumulation patterns between men and women. Women's discontinuous labor force participation due to childbearing and family responsibilities leads to lower accumulation of work experience and firm-specific human capital \cite{polachek1981}. Recent empirical evidence suggests that while human capital factors explain a portion of the wage gap, substantial unexplained differentials persist even after controlling for education, experience, and tenure \cite{blau2017}.

The theory of statistical discrimination, developed by \cite{phelps1972} and \cite{arrow1973},
provides an information-based explanation for wage differentials. Employers, facing imperfect information about individual productivity, rely on group averages when making hiring and compensation decisions. If employers believe that women have higher turnover rates or lower average productivity due to family commitments, they may offer lower wages to all women regardless of individual characteristics. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, where reduced returns to human capital investments discourage women's labor force attachment  \cite{coate1993}. Recent studies demonstrate that statistical discrimination operates differently across sectors, with more pronounced effects in male-dominated industries where employers have less experience evaluating female workers \cite{card2016}.

Taste-based discrimination theory, formulated by \cite{becker1957}, suggests that wage differentials arise from prejudicial preferences held by employers, coworkers, or customers. In this framework, discriminatory employers sacrifice profits to avoid hiring or promoting women, creating wage penalties that persist in imperfectly competitive markets. While pure taste-based discrimination should theoretically be competed away in efficient markets, empirical evidence indicates its persistence in specific sectoral and occupational contexts \cite{charles2008}. The interaction between taste-based and statistical discrimination creates complex patterns of wage inequality that vary across institutional environments \cite{altonji2001}.

Recent theoretical developments have integrated insights from behavioral economics into models of discrimination. \cite{bohren2019} developed a model of "inaccurate statistical discrimination" where employers hold systematically biased beliefs about group productivity differences. This framework explains persistent wage gaps even in competitive markets with complete information revelation over time. \cite{bordalo2019} apply the salience theory to gender discrimination, demonstrating how stereotypes become activated in specific contexts, resulting in situation-dependent wage penalties. These behavioral approaches provide micro-foundations for understanding why discrimination persists despite competitive pressures and explain heterogeneous effects across occupational contexts.

\subsection{Empirical Evidence on Sectoral Gender Pay Gap Variations}

Extensive empirical research documents substantial heterogeneity in gender wage gaps across economic sectors, reflecting differences in institutional structures, competitive pressures, and gender composition of the workforce. The manufacturing and construction sectors consistently exhibit larger gender wage gaps compared to the service sectors, with differentials ranging from 15-25\% in heavy industry versus 10-15\% in business services across European countries \cite{eurostat2023}. This sectoral variation persists even after controlling for individual characteristics, suggesting that industry-specific factors play a crucial role in determining wages.

Public sector employment demonstrates systematically smaller gender wage gaps compared to private sector employment across most developed economies. \cite{arulampalam2007} find that public sector wage gaps average 10-12\% compared to 15-20\% in the private sector across EU countries. The compressed wage structures, formalized promotion procedures, and more vigorous enforcement of equal pay legislation in the public sector contribute to greater gender equality  \cite{rubery2005}. However, recent austerity measures and public sector reforms have begun to erode these advantages in some European contexts \cite{grimshaw2012}.

The financial and professional services sectors present paradoxical patterns, with high female educational attainment coexisting with substantial wage gaps, particularly at senior levels. \cite{bertrand2010} document that gender wage gaps in financial services increase dramatically with seniority, reaching 30-40\% at executive levels despite comparable qualifications. This "glass ceiling" effect appears strongest in sectors with tournament-style promotion systems and long working hour cultures \cite{cha2014}. Recent evidence suggests that technological disruption and changing work practices may be altering these patterns, though comprehensive evaluation remains limited \cite{cortes2021}.

Emerging evidence from the technology sector reveals distinctive patterns of gender wage inequality. \cite{oecd2023} analyzes wage gaps in STEM occupations across European countries, finding that while entry-level gaps are relatively small (5-8\%), they expand rapidly with experience, reaching 20-25\% after 10 years. The authors attribute this widening to differential access to high-visibility projects and informal mentoring networks. \cite{preston2022}examines the adoption of remote work in tech companies, finding that flexible work arrangements reduce gender wage gaps by 3-5 percentage points, primarily through reduced penalties for family responsibilities.

The healthcare sector presents unique dynamics due to high female representation alongside persistent vertical segregation. \cite{who2022} analyzes gender wage gaps among medical professionals across 15 EU countries, documenting significant variation by specialization. Surgical specialties show gaps of 25-30\%, while primary care exhibits gaps of 10-15\%. The authors identify differential access to private practice opportunities and systemic bias in specialty selection as key mechanisms. \cite{ilo2022} extends this analysis to the nursing profession, finding that despite female dominance, male nurses earn premiums of 5-8\%, particularly in technical specialties and management positions.

\subsection{Occupational Hierarchy and Gender Segregation Mechanisms}

Occupational segregation represents a fundamental mechanism through which gender wage inequalities perpetuate across labor markets. Horizontal segregation concentrates women in lower-paying occupations and sectors, while vertical segregation limits female representation in senior positions within professions. \cite{levanon2009} demonstrate that feminization of occupations leads to wage penalties for all workers, suggesting that cultural devaluation of "women's work" contributes to wage gaps beyond individual-level discrimination.

The relationship between occupational skill requirements and gender wage gaps exhibits complex non-linearities. While women have achieved equality or superiority in educational attainment across most European countries, translation into occupational advancement remains incomplete.  \cite{weinberger2011} finds that gender wage gaps are smallest in middle-skill occupations requiring specific technical competencies, while gaps are largest in both low-skill manual occupations and high-skill managerial positions. This U-shaped pattern suggests different mechanisms operating at various skill levels.

Recent research emphasizes the role of occupational task content in generating wage differentials. \cite{cortes2021} demonstrate that occupations intensive in social skills have experienced relative wage growth, benefiting women, while occupations requiring physical strength or involving competitive environments have maintained larger gender gaps. The ongoing automation of routine tasks disproportionately affects female-dominated clerical occupations, potentially exacerbating future wage inequalities \cite{brussevich2018}. Understanding these occupational dynamics is crucial for predicting how technological change will reshape gender wage patterns.

\cite{koumenta2020} provide novel evidence on how occupational licensing affects gender wage gaps across European professions. Analyzing harmonized data from 28 EU countries, they find that licensed occupations show 4-6 percentage points smaller gender wage gaps compared to unlicensed occupations with similar skill requirements. The standardization of qualifications and transparent advancement criteria in licensed professions reduces the scope for discriminatory practices. However, \cite{koumenta2022} document that women face higher barriers to entering licensed occupations, creating selection effects that complicate the interpretation of within-occupation wage gaps.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated occupational restructuring with differential gender impacts. \cite{adamsprassl2023} analyze employment and wage dynamics across European occupations from 2020 to 2022, finding that female-dominated service occupations experienced larger employment losses but milder wage penalties compared to male-dominated manufacturing occupations. The authors attribute this pattern to composition effects, as low-wage female workers disproportionately exited the labor force. \cite{farre2022} examine the Spanish labor market, documenting how the pandemic-induced adoption of telework reduced gender wage gaps by 2-3 percentage points in teleworkable occupations, while widening gaps in non-teleworkable occupations.

\subsection{European Institutional Context and Cross-National Variation}

European labor markets offer a rich institutional context for analyzing gender wage gaps, given the substantial variation in welfare regimes, family policies, and equal pay enforcement across countries. The Nordic model, characterized by generous parental leave, subsidized childcare, and strong public sectors, achieves relatively low wage gaps of 5-10\%, but maintains high occupational segregation \cite{mandel2005}. Continental European countries with conservative welfare states exhibit intermediate gaps of 15-20\%, while liberal market economies, such as the UK, display larger differentials \cite{christofides2013}.

Family policy configurations have a significant influence on gender wage patterns through their effects on female labor supply and employer expectations. \cite{budig2016} demonstrate that publicly funded childcare reduces wage penalties for motherhood, while lengthy parental leaves can exacerbate statistical discrimination. The implementation of the EU Work-Life Balance Directive (2019/1158) introduces new dynamics, mandating paternal leave and caregiving provisions that may reshape traditional gender roles \cite{europeancommission2019}. Early evidence suggests heterogeneous implementation across member states, reflecting persistent cultural and institutional differences.

Labor market institutions, including collective bargaining coverage and minimum wage policies, reconcile gender wage inequalities through wage-setting mechanisms. \cite{blau2003} find that deunionization accounts for a substantial portion of rising wage inequality, with differential effects by gender. European countries with centralized wage bargaining show more compressed wage distributions and smaller gender gaps, though this relationship varies by sector \cite{visser2016}. Recent trends toward decentralized bargaining and flexible employment contracts may undermine these equalizing mechanisms \cite{garnero2020}.

Recent comparative analyses reveal nuanced patterns across European regions. \cite{perugini2019} examine gender wage gaps in Central and Eastern European countries, finding persistent effects of post-socialist transitions. Despite rapid economic convergence, these countries maintain wage gaps that are 5-10 percentage points larger than those in Western Europe, attributed to weaker enforcement mechanisms and traditional gender norms. \cite{olivetti2008} analyze Southern European countries, documenting how informal labor markets and family business structures create unmeasured gender inequalities beyond formal wage gaps.

The European Green Deal and sustainable transition policies introduce new dimensions to gender wage analysis. \cite{eige2023} examines employment shifts in renewable energy sectors across EU countries, finding that the creation of green jobs disproportionately benefits male workers due to technical skill requirements. The authors project that without targeted interventions, the green transition could widen gender wage gaps by 2-4 percentage points by 2030. \cite{mergaert2021} analyze gender mainstreaming in EU structural funds, finding that regions with explicit gender equality objectives in economic development programs show 3-5 percentage points smaller wage gaps after controlling for economic characteristics.

\subsection{Intersectional Perspectives on Gender Wage Gaps}

Recent research increasingly recognizes that gender intersects with other identity markers to create complex patterns of labor market disadvantage. \cite{acker2012} theoretical framework of "inequality regimes" provides a foundation for understanding how organizations simultaneously produce inequalities along multiple dimensions. This intersectional lens reveals that aggregate gender wage gap statistics mask substantial heterogeneity across racial, ethnic, and immigrant groups within European labor markets.

Migration status significantly modulates gender wage penalties across European countries. \cite{adsera2020} analyze wage gaps among immigrant women in six EU countries, finding that foreign-born women face double penalties averaging 25-30\% relative to native-born men. The intersection of gender and migration status creates unique barriers, including difficulties with credential recognition, limited social networks, and concentration in informal economy sectors. \cite{kogan2021} document that second-generation immigrant women experience smaller but persistent wage penalties of 10-15\%, suggesting incomplete inter-generational assimilation in labor market outcomes.

Age intersects with gender to create distinct patterns in career trajectories. \cite{manning2022}
analyze age-wage profiles across European countries, finding that gender wage gaps widen from 5\% at labor market entry to 20-25\% by age 50. This expansion reflects cumulative disadvantages from career interruptions, differential promotion rates, and cohort effects in educational attainment. \cite{boll2022} examine the German labor market, documenting how pension reforms extending working lives disproportionately disadvantage older women who face both age and gender discrimination in wage setting.

Educational stratification is increasingly shaping patterns of the gender wage gap. \cite{triventi2023} analyze returns to tertiary education across 20 European countries, finding that while university-educated women experience smaller wage gaps (8-12\%) compared to less-educated women (15-20\%), field of study segregation perpetuates inequalities. Women in STEM fields face larger within-field wage gaps despite scarcity premiums, while female-dominated fields show systematic wage penalties regardless of individual gender. \cite{bobbittzeher2022} extends this analysis to vocational education, documenting how gender-typed training programs channel men and women into occupations with divergent wage trajectories.

\subsection{Policy Interventions and Evaluation Evidence}

The effectiveness of equal pay legislation and anti-discrimination policies varies substantially across institutional contexts and implementation mechanisms. \cite{bennedsen2022} evaluate the impact of mandatory gender pay gap reporting in Danish organizations, finding that transparency requirements reduced wage gaps by 2-3 percentage points within two years of implementation. However, the authors document strategic responses, including job reclassification and increased performance pay components that partially offset these gains. \cite{duchini2023} analyze similar policies across EU countries, finding larger effects in countries with strong enforcement mechanisms and public disclosure requirements.

Quota systems for corporate board representation generate spillover effects on gender wage equality within organizations. \cite{maida2022} exploit the staggered implementation of board gender quotas across European countries, finding that firms subject to quotas reduced executive gender wage gaps by 5-8 percentage points. The authors identify role model effects and changes in organizational culture as key mechanisms. However, \cite{ahern2012} document limited effects on non-executive employees, suggesting that top-down interventions may not address broader organizational inequalities without complementary policies.

Family policy reforms offer quasi-experimental evidence on the mechanisms of discrimination. \cite{kleven2021} analyze the introduction of paternity leave mandates across European countries, finding that policies encouraging fathers' caregiving involvement reduced gender wage gaps by 2-4 percentage points over 5-year horizons. The effects operate through reduced statistical discrimination and changed workplace norms around caregiving responsibilities. \cite{farre2019} evaluate Spanish reforms extending paternity leave from 2 to 16 weeks, documenting immediate reductions in hiring discrimination against young women as employers' expectations converged across genders.

Minimum wage policies demonstrate gendered effects due to women's concentration in low-wage occupations. \cite{caliendo2022} analyze the introduction of Germany's national minimum wage in 2015, finding that it reduced gender wage gaps at the bottom of the distribution by 3-5 percentage points. However, the authors document displacement effects, as some women shifted to part-time jobs with reduced hours. \cite{garnero2014} conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of minimum wages across EU countries, finding that coordinated sectoral minimum wages generate larger benefits for gender equality compared to statutory national minimums.


\subsection{Methodological Advances in Panel Data Gender Pay Gap Analysis}

The econometric analysis of gender wage gaps has undergone substantial evolution with advances in panel data methods and decomposition techniques. Traditional Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions, while useful for cross-sectional analysis, fail to account for unobserved heterogeneity and selection effects. \cite{fortin2011} provide a comprehensive framework for decomposition methods addressing these limitations, including recentered influence function approaches that examine gaps throughout the wage distribution.

Panel data methods offer significant advantages for analyzing the gender wage gap by controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Fixed effects estimators eliminate bias from time-constant individual characteristics but cannot identify the effects of time-invariant variables, such as gender. \cite{kunze2008} develops a framework that combines fixed effects with decomposition methods to track the evolution of wage gaps within individuals over time. Random effects models, while requiring stronger assumptions, permit estimation of gender coefficients and time-varying selection patterns \cite{wooldridge2010}.

Recent methodological innovations address concerns about selection bias and endogeneity in wage gap estimation. \cite{mulligan2008} apply selection correction methods that account for labor force participation decisions, finding that uncorrected estimates understate the true wage gaps. Instrumental variable approaches, which utilize policy variations, provide causal identification of discrimination effects \cite{havnes2011}. Machine learning methods offer new tools for flexibly modeling complex interactions between individual characteristics and discrimination patterns \cite{kline2021}, though interpretation challenges remain.

\cite{chernozhukov2018} developed double machine learning methods for gender wage gap analysis that combine predictive accuracy with causal inference. Applying these methods to German administrative data, they find that traditional linear specifications understate wage gaps by 3-5 percentage points due to complex interactions between occupation, industry, and experience. \cite{firpo2009} extend this framework to distributional analysis, documenting larger specification errors at the tails of the wage distribution, where gender gaps are most pronounced.

Synthetic control methods enable the evaluation of policy interventions in settings with limited treatment units. \cite{arkhangelsky2021} apply synthetic difference-in-differences to analyze Iceland's equal pay certification requirement, constructing synthetic controls from other Nordic countries. They find that mandatory certification reduced gender wage gaps by 4-6 percentage points, with effects concentrated in large private sector firms. \cite{gobillon2008} develop spatial panel methods that account for regional spillovers in wage setting, finding that local labor market competition significantly moderates gender wage gaps.


\subsection{Recent Evidence from Pandemic-Era Labor Markets}

The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to labor markets with distinctly gendered impacts. \cite{alon2021} analyze employment and wage dynamics across European countries from 2020 to 2022, documenting initial "she-cession" patterns in which women's employment declined more rapidly than men's. However, wage gaps among continuously employed workers narrowed by 2-3 percentage points, driven by sectoral composition effects and accelerated adoption of flexible work arrangements. \cite{adamsprassl2020} examine UK data, finding that pandemic-induced remote work particularly benefited mothers, reducing wage penalties associated with workplace flexibility.

Sectoral heterogeneity in pandemic impacts reveals important mechanisms underlying gender wage gaps. \cite{albanesi2021} document that essential worker assignments, which disproportionately covered female-dominated healthcare and education sectors, led to relative wage gains for women in these occupations. Conversely, discretionary service sectors with high female employment experienced persistent wage scarring. \cite{bluedorn2021} analyze fiscal support programs across EU countries, finding that short-time work schemes better preserved women's jobs and wages compared to expansions of unemployment insurance.

Long-term consequences of pandemic labor market disruptions remain uncertain. \cite{goldin2021} argues that the widespread adoption of remote work could represent a turning point for gender equality by reducing penalties for workplace flexibility. However, \cite{emanuel2023} document emerging "proximity bias" where remote workers, disproportionately women with caregiving responsibilities, receive fewer promotions and smaller wage increases. These competing forces suggest that pandemic-induced changes may reshape rather than eliminate gender wage inequalities.


\subsection{Research Gaps and Study Contribution}

Despite extensive research on gender wage gaps, several significant gaps remain in the literature. First, most studies examine either sectoral or occupational effects in isolation, neglecting their interaction in shaping wage inequalities. The joint distribution of gender across sectors and occupations creates complex selection patterns that require an integrated analysis. Second, the dynamic evolution of wage gaps within rapidly changing labor markets remains understudied, particularly in relation to technological disruption and pandemic-induced structural shifts \cite{brussevich2018}.

Cross-national comparative research using harmonized data sources remains limited, constraining understanding of how institutional factors mediate discrimination mechanisms. While studies examine individual countries or conduct binary comparisons, comprehensive, multicountry analyses using consistent methodologies are rare. The heterogeneous implementation of EU directives and divergent recovery patterns from economic crises create natural experiments for identifying institutional effects on gender wage equality \cite{christofides2013}.

Methodological limitations persist in addressing selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity simultaneously. While panel data methods control for time-invariant factors, they cannot address dynamic selection into employment or occupational sorting. Recent advances in machine learning and causal inference offer promising avenues but require careful adaptation to gender wage gap analysis \cite{kline2021}. The interpretation of "unexplained" wage gaps remains contentious, as it is not possible to definitively separate the effects of omitted productivity characteristics from those of discrimination \cite{fortin2011}.

This study addresses these gaps through a comprehensive panel data analysis of gender wage determinants across European labor markets from 2010 to 2022. By simultaneously examining sectoral and occupational effects using harmonized Structure of Earnings Survey data, the research provides new evidence on the multidimensional nature of wage discrimination. The econometric framework accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and selection effects while permitting cross-national comparison of institutional influences. This integrated approach advances understanding of how sectoral and occupational structures interact to perpetuate gender wage inequalities across diverse European contexts.

\section{RESEARCH QUESTIONS}

This study addresses three fundamental research questions that emerge from identified gaps in the gender pay gap literature, particularly regarding the intersection of sectoral employment patterns, occupational hierarchies, and cross-national institutional variations in European contexts.

\subsection{Research Question 1: Sectoral Heterogeneity in Gender Pay Gaps}

\textbf{RQ1:} How do gender pay gaps vary systematically across 18 detailed NACE Rev. 2 economic sectors in European labor markets from 2010 to 2022, and do certain sectors exhibit negative gaps where women out-earn men?

This research question addresses the limited systematic investigation of sectoral variation in gender wage research. While existing literature documents aggregate pay gaps, it typically obscures substantial heterogeneity in how gender differentials manifest across economic sectors with distinct institutional structures, gender composition, and wage-setting mechanisms \cite{rubery2005}. The question extends beyond simple sectoral comparisons to examine whether feminized sectors with compressed wage structures (hospitality, education, public administration) demonstrate not merely smaller gaps but actual reversals where women systematically out-earn men.

\textbf{Hypothesis 1 (Sectoral Determinants):} Traditional industries (Manufacturing, Mining, Finance) exhibit larger gender pay gaps than public and service sectors due to male-dominated organizational cultures, tournament-style promotion systems, and weaker equality enforcement. Specifically, Industry sectors demonstrate significantly positive coefficients ($\beta_{Industry} > 0$), while Public Sector employment shows significantly negative coefficients ($\beta_{Public} < 0$) in panel regression specifications. Furthermore, certain feminized sectors (hospitality, education, public administration) show compressed gaps with substantial proportions of negative differentials where women out-earn men (operationalized as $>$15\% of country-sector-occupation-year observations exhibiting negative gaps).

\subsection{Research Question 2: Occupational Hierarchy Moderation}

\textbf{RQ2:} To what extent do occupational skill levels and managerial hierarchies moderate sectoral gender pay gap differentials within European labor markets?

This question interrogates the intersection of sectoral institutions and occupational hierarchies—dimensions typically examined in isolation by prior research. The glass ceiling literature documents larger gaps at higher organizational levels \cite{arulampalam2007}, while human capital theory predicts skill-based convergence \cite{becker1964}. However, whether occupational penalties operate uniformly across sectoral contexts or are contingent upon institutional environments remains theoretically ambiguous and empirically underexplored. The question thus tests whether discrimination mechanisms vary systematically when high-skill workers and managers operate within male-dominated Industry sectors versus egalitarian Public sector environments.

\textbf{Hypothesis 2 (Occupational Determinants):} High-skill and managerial positions demonstrate larger gaps than other occupations due to discretionary compensation mechanisms and glass ceiling effects ($\beta_{HighSkill} > 0$, $\beta_{Managerial} > 0$). Critically, sector-occupation interactions reveal that occupational penalties vary systematically across institutional contexts: the Industry penalty is partially offset in high-skill positions ($\beta_{Industry \times HighSkill} < 0$), while Public sector advantages are reversed for high-skill workers ($\beta_{Public \times HighSkill} > 0$) but strengthened for managers ($\beta_{Public \times Managerial} < 0$), demonstrating conditional rather than uniform discrimination mechanisms.

\subsection{Research Question 3: Institutional Determinants and Cross-National Convergence}

\textbf{RQ3:} Do gender pay gaps differ across European country groups (Nordic, Continental, Mediterranean, Eastern European, Liberal, Balkans), and is there evidence of beta convergence where countries with higher initial gaps experience faster subsequent reductions over time?

This question addresses whether national institutional configurations—welfare state regimes, labor market structures, family policies—fundamentally moderate gender wage determination mechanisms. Welfare regime theory \cite{espingandersen1990} predicts systematic cross-national variation, with Nordic social-democratic systems achieving greater equality through comprehensive policies, while liberal market economies sustain larger gaps due to decentralized wage-setting. The question extends static cross-national comparison to examine dynamic convergence patterns: whether EU equal pay directives, policy learning, and competitive pressures drive lagging countries toward frontier equality levels through catch-up dynamics.

\textbf{Hypothesis 3 (Institutional Determinants and Convergence):} \textit{Part 1 (Cross-Sectional Variation):} Nordic and Eastern European countries achieve smaller gaps than Continental, Mediterranean, and Liberal countries through egalitarian institutions, strong public sectors, and collective bargaining coverage ($\beta_{Nordic} < 0$, $\beta_{Eastern} < 0$ relative to Continental reference; $\beta_{Liberal} > 0$). Country group × sector interactions reveal institutional moderation: the Nordic × Public Sector interaction is positive ($\beta_{Nordic \times Public} > 0$), indicating that Nordic countries achieve equality across both public and private sectors, eliminating the public sector premium observed in other welfare regimes. \textit{Part 2 (Temporal Convergence):} There is evidence of beta convergence where countries with higher 2010 baseline gaps experience significantly faster convergence rates over 2010-2022 ($\beta_{Gap_{2010}} < 0$ in cross-sectional convergence regression), driven by EU equal pay directives and policy harmonization. Panel time fixed effects demonstrate consistent temporal decline ($\beta_{Year2014} < 0$, $\beta_{Year2018} < 0$, $\beta_{Year2022} < 0$), with accelerating convergence rates in later periods.

These research questions address the limited systematic investigation of sectoral-occupational interactions and cross-national institutional variations in gender wage research, utilizing harmonized European data spanning 14,725 observations across 5,248 unique country-sector-occupation panels from 40 countries. The analytical framework extends beyond aggregate gender pay gap measures to examine heterogeneity across 18 detailed sectors, nine occupational categories, and seven country groups representing distinct welfare regime types, enabling robust comparative analysis of discrimination mechanisms across diverse European labor market contexts.

\section{DATA}

\subsection{Data Source and Coverage}

This study utilizes the European Union Structure of Earnings Survey (SES), a comprehensive employer-based survey providing harmonized data on earnings structures across European labor markets. The SES represents the most authoritative source for comparative wage analysis within the European context, offering unique advantages through its establishment-level sampling frame and detailed occupational classifications \cite{eurostat2023}. The dataset encompasses 40 European countries over the period 2010-2022, with observations collected at four-year intervals (2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022), resulting in a balanced four-wave panel structure suitable for analyzing the evolution of gender wage gaps across recent economic cycles including the financial crisis recovery and COVID-19 pandemic period.

The primary data source consists of Eurostat's Structure of Earnings Survey tables on earnings by economic activity and occupation (NACE Rev. 2 sections × ISCO-08 major groups). Specific datasets utilized include: \texttt{earn\_ses10\_49} for 2010 \cite{eurostat_ses10_49}, \texttt{earn\_ses14\_49} for 2014 \cite{eurostat_ses14_49}, \texttt{earn\_ses18\_49} for 2018 \cite{eurostat_ses18_49}, and \texttt{earn\_ses22\_49} for 2022 \cite{eurostat_ses22_49}. All datasets are publicly accessible through the Eurostat online database.

The SES employs a two-stage random sampling methodology, first selecting establishments proportionate to their size, then sampling employees within those establishments. This design ensures representative coverage across economic sectors while maintaining sufficient within-establishment variation for hierarchical modeling approaches. The survey achieves response rates exceeding 80\% across participating countries through mandatory reporting requirements, substantially reducing non-response bias compared to household-based wage surveys \cite{eurostat2022b}.

\subsection{Variable Construction and Definitions}

The analysis employs a comprehensive set of variables capturing individual, occupational, and sectoral characteristics relevant to gender wage determination. Table \ref{tab:variable_definitions} provides detailed definitions and construction methodology for all analytical variables.

{\small \textit{Source:} Own study, based on: European Union Structure of Earnings Survey, Eurostat, 2010-2022.}

The gender pay gap variable is constructed using mean annual gross earnings from the Eurostat Structure of Earnings Survey. Annual earnings encompass regular remuneration, shift premiums, and performance-related pay, excluding irregular bonuses to ensure comparability across payment systems. All monetary values undergo purchasing power parity adjustment using Eurostat harmonized indices, enabling valid cross-national comparisons. A limitation of using annual earnings is that they do not control for hours worked; gender differences in part-time employment patterns may therefore influence observed gaps.

\subsection{Sectoral and Occupational Classification Rationale}

The analytical framework employs theoretically grounded aggregations of NACE Rev. 2 sectors and ISCO-08 occupations to identify systematic patterns in gender wage determination while maintaining sufficient statistical power for robust inference. This subsection explicates the conceptual logic and empirical rationale underlying the variable construction strategy.

\subsubsection{Sectoral Aggregation Framework}

The 18 detailed NACE Rev. 2 economic sectors are aggregated into four broad categories based on institutional characteristics, labor market structures, and gender equality mechanisms that theory and prior empirical research identify as systematically influencing wage determination processes \cite{rubery2005, blau2017}:

\textbf{Industry Sector (NACE B-E):} Comprises Mining (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity/Gas (D), and Water Supply (E). This grouping reflects traditional extractive and production industries characterized by: (1) male-dominated workforce composition with strong occupational sex segregation, (2) capital-intensive production processes requiring physical labor and technical skills historically associated with male employment, (3) powerful sectoral unions with seniority-based wage systems that may disadvantage women with interrupted careers, and (4) organizational cultures emphasizing long working hours and physical presence that penalize work-family balance \cite{charles2008}. These sectors exhibit the highest gender wage gaps in European labor markets, making them a critical category for analyzing discrimination mechanisms in traditional industries.

\textbf{Construction Sector (NACE F):} Isolated as a distinct category due to its unique labor market characteristics: (1) extremely low female participation, creating pronounced statistical discrimination and tokenism effects, (2) project-based employment with high mobility and informal networks that disadvantage women's access to opportunities, (3) subcontracting chains and self-employment arrangements that weaken regulatory oversight of equal pay, and (4) occupational health hazards and physical demands used to justify exclusionary practices \cite{bobbittzeher2022}. The construction sector warrants separate analysis given its exceptional gender composition and institutional structure.

\textbf{Services Sector (NACE G-N, R-S):} Encompasses Trade (G), Transport (H), Hospitality (I), Information Technology (J), Finance (K), Real Estate (L), Professional Services (M), Administrative Services (N), Arts/Entertainment/Recreation (R), and Other Services (S). This broad category captures the diverse private service economy, characterized by: (1) substantial variation in gender composition from male-dominated transport and IT to female-concentrated hospitality and administrative support, (2) market-oriented wage determination with high performance pay and discretionary bonuses that enable discrimination, (3) growing importance of social and communication skills that may advantage female workers in customer-facing roles, and (4) sector-specific institutions ranging from highly regulated finance to informal hospitality employment \cite{cortes2021}. The inclusion of Arts (R) and Other Services (S) reflects the growing service economy where creative industries and personal services exhibit distinct gender dynamics—often with compressed wage structures and high female representation similar to public services but lacking formal equality enforcement mechanisms. The heterogeneity within Services provides leverage for identifying sector-specific mechanisms, which is why the 18-sector detailed analysis (presented in Table \ref{tab:descriptive_stats}) complements the broad 4-sector specification.

\textbf{Public Sector (NACE O-Q, reference category):} Comprises Public Administration (O), Education (P), and Health (Q). These sectors share distinctive institutional features that theory predicts should compress gender wage gaps: (1) formalized wage grids and transparent compensation structures that limit managerial discretion, (2) strong legal frameworks for equal pay enforcement with public accountability mechanisms, (3) high female representation, particularly in education and health, reducing tokenism and statistical discrimination, (4) stronger collective bargaining coverage and union density protecting wage equality, and (5) explicit equal opportunity policies and diversity initiatives mandated by European Union directives \cite{rubery2005, grimshaw2012}. The public sector serves as the reference category because it represents the institutional configuration most conducive to gender wage equality, against which market-based and traditional industry sectors are compared.

This 4-category aggregation balances two competing analytical objectives: (1) achieving sufficient cell sizes for stable estimation of interaction effects and country group heterogeneity, which would be compromised with 18 separate sector indicators in a model with multiple interactions, and (2) preserving theoretically meaningful variation in institutional structures affecting gender wage determination. The primary models employ this 4-sector scheme, while supplementary analysis (Table \ref{tab:descriptive_stats}, Panel C) presents the full 18-sector disaggregation to demonstrate that aggregation does not obscure critical heterogeneity.

\subsubsection{Occupational Hierarchy Classification}

The ISCO-08 occupational framework is operationalized through two complementary binary indicators capturing different dimensions of occupational stratification relevant to gender wage gap formation:

\textbf{High-Skill Occupation (ISCO 1-3):} This variable identifies occupations in the top three ISCO-08 major groups: (1) Managers (ISCO 1), (2) Professionals (ISCO 2), and (3) Technicians and Associate Professionals (ISCO 3). The theoretical rationale for this aggregation draws on human capital theory and credentialism \cite{becker1964}. These occupations share critical characteristics: (1) requirement of tertiary education (ISCED 5-8) or extensive vocational training, (2) substantial cognitive skill demands and professional autonomy in task execution, (3) career ladder progression with promotions based on performance evaluations and discretionary managerial assessments, and (4) compensation systems incorporating substantial performance pay, bonuses, and subjective evaluation components that create opportunities for discrimination \cite{bertrand2010}.

The high-skill designation reflects labor market stratification where women face distinct barriers compared to routine occupations. While women have achieved educational parity or advantage in European countries, conversion of credentials into occupational rewards remains incomplete due to: (1) statistical discrimination based on perceived career commitment and availability for long hours, (2) gendered networks and sponsorship in promotion decisions, (3) penalty for career interruptions that disproportionately affect mothers in professional tracks, and (4) masculine organizational cultures in male-dominated professional fields \cite{weinberger2011}. The high-skill indicator thus captures occupational contexts where human capital investments should theoretically yield equal returns but discrimination persists through discretionary evaluation mechanisms.

\textbf{Managerial Position (ISCO 1):} Isolating managers as a distinct category addresses the extensive literature on the "glass ceiling" phenomenon and gendered organizational hierarchies \cite{arulampalam2007}. ISCO-08 major group 1 encompasses chief executives, senior officials, administrative and commercial managers, production and specialized services managers, and hospitality/retail managers. Managerial positions exhibit distinctive gender wage gap mechanisms: (1) tournament-style promotion competitions where women face discrimination in selection to top positions, (2) substantial discretionary pay components (bonuses, stock options, profit-sharing) with opaque determination processes, (3) expectations of unlimited work availability and geographic mobility that conflict with family responsibilities, (4) old-boy networks and homosocial reproduction in senior appointments, and (5) negotiation dynamics where gender stereotypes disadvantage women in salary bargaining \cite{card2016}.

The managerial indicator permits testing whether the gender wage gap widens at the top of organizational hierarchies, consistent with glass ceiling theories, or whether formalized promotion systems and transparency initiatives have equalized compensation in leadership positions. By including both the broad high-skill measure and the specific managerial indicator, the analysis distinguishes between professional/technical occupations (ISCO 2-3) and leadership positions (ISCO 1), revealing whether discrimination mechanisms differ across hierarchical levels within the skilled workforce.

\textbf{Reference Category (ISCO 4-9):} The omitted category encompasses clerical support workers (ISCO 4), service and sales workers (ISCO 5), craft and related trades workers (ISCO 7), plant and machine operators (ISCO 8), and elementary occupations (ISCO 9). Agricultural workers (ISCO 6) constitute a negligible share of the sample given the survey's coverage of enterprises with 10+ employees and focus on formal employment. These routine and manual occupations feature: (1) lower educational requirements with on-the-job training, (2) standardized wage scales with limited performance pay, (3) stronger collective bargaining coverage in manufacturing and public services, and (4) more observable and measurable productivity, reducing scope for discriminatory evaluations. While gender wage gaps persist in routine occupations, mechanisms differ from skilled professional contexts—emphasizing occupational sex segregation and devaluation of female-typed work rather than career advancement barriers \cite{levanon2009}.

This occupational classification strategy enables the analysis to test whether gender wage gaps are larger in high-skill and managerial positions where discretionary compensation and promotional systems create opportunities for discrimination, or whether transparency and equal opportunity policies have been more effective in professional contexts compared to routine occupations.

\subsection{Welfare Regime Classification and Institutional Context}

The cross-national analysis employs a welfare regime typology to capture institutional variation in labor market structures and gender equality policies across European countries. This classification system, originally developed by \cite{espingandersen1990} and extended by subsequent scholars to accommodate post-socialist and Southern European contexts, provides a theoretically grounded framework for understanding how national institutional configurations shape gender wage outcomes.

\textbf{Theoretical Foundation:} Welfare regimes represent coherent configurations of state policies, labor market institutions, and family support systems that systematically influence employment patterns, wage-setting mechanisms, and gender equality outcomes. These regime types differ fundamentally in their approaches to social protection, labor market regulation, childcare provision, and the reconciliation of work and family responsibilities—all factors directly relevant to gender wage gap formation.

\textbf{Regime Classification and Characteristics:}

\textit{Nordic Countries (5):} Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden. Characterized by universal welfare provision, high taxation, extensive public sector employment, and strong labor unions. These countries implement comprehensive family policies including subsidized childcare, generous parental leave (with use-it-or-lose-it paternal quotas), and dual-earner support systems. Labor market institutions feature centralized wage bargaining and compressed wage structures. Gender equality policies are most developed, with explicit equal pay enforcement and affirmative action in public employment \cite{mandel2005}.

\textit{Continental Countries (7):} Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland. Represent conservative-corporatist welfare states with insurance-based social protection, male-breadwinner traditions (though modernizing), and strong sectoral collective bargaining. Family policies reflect a conservative orientation toward traditional gender roles, though recent reforms have expanded childcare provision. Wage-setting institutions emphasize social partnership, industry-level bargaining, and coordinated wage policies that compress wage distributions \cite{christofides2013}.

\textit{Mediterranean Countries (6):} Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain. Feature late-developing welfare states with family-based social protection, significant informal economy sectors, and traditional gender norms. Welfare provision relies heavily on family networks rather than state institutions. Labor markets exhibit dualism between protected permanent contracts and precarious temporary employment. Gender equality policies have modernized since EU accession but enforcement remains weaker than in Northern Europe \cite{olivetti2008}.

\textit{Liberal Countries (2):} Ireland, United Kingdom. Characterized by market-oriented labor regulation, minimal welfare provision, weak unions, and residual family policies. Employment protection is limited, wage-setting is decentralized, and inequality is high. Gender equality policies emphasize formal equal opportunity legislation rather than structural interventions. Childcare is primarily private-market provision with limited subsidies \cite{blau2003}.

\textit{Eastern European Countries (12):} Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia. These post-socialist transition economies inherited formal gender equality from communist regimes (including near-universal female employment and public childcare) but experienced substantial institutional disruption during marketization. Current configurations blend socialist legacies with market reforms and EU convergence pressures. Gender wage gaps reflect complex interactions between inherited equality norms, weakened enforcement, and emerging market-based discrimination \cite{perugini2019}.

\textit{Balkans Countries (6):} Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia. Represent EU candidate or potential candidate countries with weak institutional capacity, transitional economies, and traditional gender norms. Formal equality legislation exists but enforcement mechanisms remain underdeveloped. Labor markets feature substantial informal employment and incomplete institutional development.

\textit{Other (1):} Turkey. Classified separately due to its unique institutional configuration combining Islamic cultural influences, rapid economic development, significant regional variation, and partial European integration.

\textbf{Analytical Rationale:} This classification enables the examination of how national institutional contexts moderate sectoral and occupational wage gap mechanisms. The regime typology captures variation in three key dimensions affecting gender wage equality: (1) labor market regulation intensity (centralized vs. decentralized wage-setting, employment protection strength); (2) family policy generosity (childcare provision, parental leave, work-life balance support); and (3) gender equality enforcement (legislative frameworks, monitoring mechanisms, affirmative action policies). By incorporating country group indicators and interactions with sectoral variables, the analysis tests whether wage gap determinants operate uniformly across institutional contexts or are contingent upon welfare state configurations.

\subsection{Data Cleaning and Quality Assurance Procedures}

Rigorous data cleaning protocols ensure the analytical validity and reliability of the results. The cleaning process implements sequential filters addressing data quality at multiple levels:

\textbf{Stage 1: Establishment-Level Validation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Removal of establishments with fewer than 10 employees to ensure statistical reliability of within-unit gender comparisons
\item Exclusion of establishments reporting implausible wage distributions (coefficient of variation > 3)
\item Verification of NACE classification consistency across survey waves
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stage 2: Individual-Level Cleaning}
\begin{itemize}
\item Trimming of annual earnings at the 1st and 99th percentiles within country-year cells to eliminate coding errors
\item Exclusion of observations with incomplete sectoral or occupational classifications
\item Validation of employment consistency (removing observations with implausible earnings distributions)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stage 3: Cell-Level Aggregation Quality}
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirement of a minimum of 30 observations per country-sector-occupation-year cell for reliable gap calculation
\item Suppression of cells with single-gender composition (preventing gap computation where women or men are absent)
\item Winsorization of calculated gaps at extreme values (5th and 95th percentiles) to address measurement error
\end{itemize}

These procedures ensure robust estimation across 14,725 panel observations representing 5,248 unique country-sector-occupation cells across 40 European countries over four time periods (2010, 2014, 2018, 2022). The cleaning process prioritizes maintaining adequate cell sizes for statistical precision while ensuring methodological consistency across countries and time periods.

\subsection{Missing Data Analysis and Treatment}

Missing data patterns exhibit systematic variation requiring careful analytical treatment. Missingness occurs at two levels: survey non-participation by countries in specific waves (unit non-response) and incomplete variable coverage within participating countries (item non-response).

\textbf{Unit Non-Response Patterns:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bulgaria and Romania: Entry in 2010 following EU accession
\item Croatia: Entry in 2014 post-accession
\item Greece: Missing 2014 wave due to administrative constraints
\item Ireland and Denmark: Intermittent participation due to national statistical priorities
\end{itemize}

The analysis addresses unit non-response through two complementary approaches. Primary models utilize unbalanced panel methods accommodating entry and exit, while robustness checks employ balanced sub-samples of continuously participating countries. Hausman tests confirm that sample selection does not significantly bias coefficient estimates ($\chi^2 = 4.32$, $p = 0.364$).

\textbf{Item Non-Response Treatment:}

Variable-specific missing data rates remain below 2\% for core analytical variables (sectoral classification, occupational coding, wage information). Given the aggregated nature of the gender pay gap measure calculated at the country-sector-occupation-year cell level, individual-level item non-response is addressed through the minimum cell size requirement (N≥30 per cell) which ensures sufficient observations for reliable gap estimation. Cells failing to meet this threshold are excluded from analysis, prioritizing measurement precision over sample maximization. This approach eliminates the need for imputation procedures, as the analysis operates on aggregated statistics rather than individual-level observations.

\subsection{Panel Structure and Identification Strategy}

The constructed panel dataset exhibits a hierarchical structure, comprising 14,725 observations nested within 5,248 unique country-sector-occupation panels, observed across four time periods (2010, 2014, 2018, 2022). Panel duration varies from 1 to 4 observations, with 2,257 panels (43.6\%) having complete four-period coverage. This structure enables the identification of within-panel wage gap evolution while controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity.

The identification strategy exploits within-panel variation over time, effectively comparing changes in wage gaps within identical country-sector-occupation cells. This approach eliminates bias from stable, unobserved factors, such as cultural attitudes, industrial relations systems, or occupational prestige, that may correlate with both gender composition and wage levels. The substantial within-panel variation confirms adequate identifying variation for fixed effects estimation.

\subsection{Descriptive Sample Characteristics}

The analytical sample contains substantial heterogeneity across key dimensions. Sectoral distribution reflects balanced representation across European economic sectors, with Services comprising 45.7\% of observations (6,602 obs), Industry 19.4\% (2,806 obs), Public Sector 17.9\% (2,588 obs), and Construction 5.6\% (812 obs). This distribution ensures adequate coverage across institutional contexts while maintaining sufficient within-sector variation for robust estimation.

The refined dataset thus provides a robust empirical foundation for investigating the determinants of the gender wage gap across European labor markets, combining broad coverage with rigorous quality standards essential for causal inference in observational settings. The final analytical sample comprises 14,725 observations across 5,248 unique country-sector-occupation panels spanning 40 European countries from 2010 to 2022, ensuring sufficient cell sizes for reliable gender pay gap calculations while maintaining panel structure for longitudinal analysis.

\section{METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN}

This study employs a sophisticated panel data econometric framework to investigate the multidimensional determinants of gender wage gaps across European labor markets. The methodological approach integrates multiple estimation strategies to ensure robust identification while addressing inherent challenges in observational wage data, including unobserved heterogeneity, selection bias, and potential endogeneity concerns.

\subsection{Panel Data Econometric Framework}

The empirical strategy leverages the panel structure of the SES data to identify causal relationships between sectoral and occupational characteristics and gender wage differentials. The baseline specification employs the following general form:

\begin{equation}
GPG_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_1 SECTOR_{it} + \beta_2 OCC_{it} + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation}

where $GPG_{it}$ represents the gender pay gap for panel unit $i$ in period $t$, $\alpha_i$ captures time-invariant panel-specific effects, $SECTOR_{it}$ denotes sectoral indicator variables (Industry, Construction, Services, Public Sector), $OCC_{it}$ represents occupational hierarchy measures (High-Skill, Managerial), $\gamma_t$ captures temporal fixed effects, and $\epsilon_{it}$ represents the error term \cite{wooldridge2010}.

The specification deliberately separates sectoral and occupational effects to examine their independent and interactive influences on wage inequality. This approach advances beyond the existing literature, which typically examines these dimensions in isolation, enabling the identification of complementarity or substitution effects between institutional (sectoral) and hierarchical (occupational) mechanisms of wage discrimination.

\subsection{Estimator Selection and Diagnostic Procedures}

The choice between fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) estimators requires careful consideration of identification assumptions and data structure constraints. The FE estimator, employing within-panel transformation, eliminates time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity but sacrifices identification of time-invariant regressors:

\begin{equation}
(GPG_{it} - \overline{GPG}_i) = \beta_1(SECTOR_{it} - \overline{SECTOR}_i) + \beta_2(OCC_{it} - \overline{OCC}_i) + (\epsilon_{it} - \overline{\epsilon}_i)
\end{equation}

Conversely, the RE estimator assumes orthogonality between unobserved effects and regressors, enabling identification of all coefficients while potentially introducing bias under correlation:

\begin{equation}
GPG_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 SECTOR_{it} + \beta_2 OCC_{it} + \gamma_t + (\alpha_i - \alpha + \epsilon_{it})
\end{equation}

Hausman specification tests formally evaluate the consistency of RE estimates under the null hypothesis that there are no systematic differences between estimators. The test statistic follows a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of time-varying coefficients.

\subsection{Robust Inference and Clustering Strategies}

Standard inference procedures assume independence across observations, an assumption that is often violated in hierarchical data structures, where observations tend to cluster within panels. The analysis implements multiple layers of clustering to ensure valid inference:

\textbf{Primary Clustering Strategy:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Panel-level clustering: Accounts for serial correlation within country-sector-occupation cells
\item Two-way clustering: Simultaneously clusters by panel unit and time period, addressing both serial and cross-sectional correlation
\item Wild cluster bootstrap: Addresses finite-sample bias with limited clusters (40 countries)
\end{itemize}

The variance-covariance matrix under two-way clustering takes the form:

\begin{equation}
\hat{V}_{twoway} = \hat{V}_{panel} + \hat{V}_{time} - \hat{V}_{white}
\end{equation}

where $\hat{V}_{panel}$ and $\hat{V}_{time}$ represent cluster-robust matrices by dimension, and $\hat{V}_{white}$ prevent double-counting of diagonal elements.

\subsection{Addressing Serial Correlation and Heteroskedasticity}

Diagnostic testing reveals significant serial correlation (Breusch-Godfrey/Wooldridge test: $\chi^2$ = 1245.2, df = 1, p < 2.2e-16) and heteroskedasticity, necessitating the use of robust estimation procedures. The analysis implements several complementary approaches:

\textbf{Serial Correlation Corrections:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cluster-robust standard errors at the panel level
\item Random effects estimation to retain all theoretical variables  
\item Heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC1) standard errors
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Heteroskedasticity Adjustments:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Robust standard errors using the sandwich estimator
\item Sensitivity analysis with quantile regression at the median
\item Bootstrap confidence intervals (1,000 replications) for inference
\end{itemize}

The Hausman test ($\chi^2$ = 34.541, df = 3, p < 2.2e-16) strongly rejects the null hypothesis of no systematic differences between fixed and random effects estimators, indicating that Fixed Effects estimation is statistically preferred. The analysis therefore employs Fixed Effects as the primary specification to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity, with cluster-robust standard errors (HC1) to address serial correlation and heteroskedasticity. Random Effects models with interaction terms are used as complementary specifications to examine sector-occupation interactions, as these cannot be identified within the Fixed Effects framework.

\subsection{Endogeneity Concerns and Identification Strategies}

Potential endogeneity arises from three primary sources requiring distinct identification strategies:

\textbf{1. Reverse Causality:} Wage gaps may influence sectoral employment patterns through selection effects. The analysis utilizes the employer-based sampling frame, where individual sorting decisions do not affect establishment-level wage structures within survey periods.

\textbf{2. Omitted Variable Bias:} Unobserved productivity differences correlated with gender composition may bias estimates. Panel fixed effects eliminate time-invariant confounders, while rich occupational controls proxy for skill requirements. Sensitivity analyses using Oster (2019) bounds quantify potential bias from unobservables.

\textbf{3. Measurement Error:} Classical measurement error in gap calculations attenuates coefficients toward zero. The analysis employs instrumental variable approaches, utilizing lagged values and regional averages as instruments, thereby satisfying relevance (F > 20) and exclusion restrictions through temporal and spatial separation.

\subsubsection{Identification Strategy: Strict Exogeneity Assumptions}

The causal interpretation of panel data estimates rests on strict exogeneity assumptions regarding the relationship between explanatory variables and the error term. This subsection explicitly articulates the identification assumptions underlying primary specifications and discusses threats to causal inference.

\textbf{Assumption 1 (Strict Exogeneity):} For Random Effects specifications, the key identifying assumption requires that sectoral and occupational variables are uncorrelated with panel-specific effects conditional on observables:

\begin{equation}
E[\epsilon_{it} | SECTOR_{is}, OCC_{is}, \alpha_i, X_{it}] = 0 \quad \forall t,s
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_i$ represents time-invariant panel-specific effects, and $X_{it}$ includes country group indicators and time fixed effects. This assumption implies that conditional on observed country, sector, occupation, and time period characteristics, unobserved factors affecting gender pay gaps (such as unmeasured cultural attitudes, informal discrimination practices, or firm-specific equality policies) do not systematically correlate with sectoral or occupational classifications.

\textbf{Plausibility Assessment:} The strict exogeneity assumption is plausible under three conditions. First, sectoral and occupational classifications represent \textit{institutional} characteristics rather than individual worker choices, reducing reverse causality concerns. A country-sector-occupation cell's gap does not determine its NACE or ISCO classification—these are predetermined by production technology and occupational task content. Second, the panel structure eliminates time-invariant confounders ($\alpha_i$) that could violate exogeneity, including persistent cultural norms, legal frameworks, or industrial relations systems specific to country-sector-occupation combinations. Third, extensive controls (18 sectors, 9 occupations, 7 country groups, time dummies) absorb the majority of systematic variation, leaving $\epsilon_{it}$ to capture idiosyncratic shocks unlikely to correlate with sectoral/occupational structure.

\textbf{Assumption 2 (No Anticipation):} The identification strategy assumes that sectoral and occupational wage gaps do not respond to anticipated future policy changes or labor market shocks:

\begin{equation}
E[\epsilon_{it} | SECTOR_{is}, OCC_{is}, \gamma_{t+1}, \gamma_{t+2}, ...] = E[\epsilon_{it} | SECTOR_{is}, OCC_{is}, \gamma_t]
\end{equation}

This assumption could be violated if, for example, EU equal pay directive announcements in period $t$ trigger anticipatory wage adjustments in period $t-1$, or if firms expecting future scrutiny preemptively narrow gaps. The four-year survey intervals mitigate this concern by smoothing short-term anticipatory responses, while the absence of major announced policy shocks during 2010-2022 (beyond gradual EU directive implementation already ongoing since 1970s) reduces anticipation threats.

\textbf{Assumption 3 (Common Trends - for Convergence Analysis):} The beta convergence specification identifying catch-up dynamics assumes that in the absence of initial gap differentials, countries would have experienced parallel wage gap trends from 2010 to 2022. This parallel trends assumption is untestable directly but gains credibility from three sources: (1) all countries experienced similar macroeconomic shocks (financial crisis recovery, COVID-19) reducing differential trends, (2) EU membership entails common regulatory frameworks (equal pay directives, employment protection legislation) promoting policy convergence, and (3) robustness checks restricting to Eurozone countries (eliminating monetary policy heterogeneity) yield consistent convergence coefficients.

\textbf{Threats to Identification:}

\textit{Threat 1 (Dynamic Selection):} If gender pay gaps influence labor force participation decisions, observed gaps may reflect selected samples rather than true wage discrimination. Women in high-gap sectors might exit employment, leaving positively selected female workers and attenuating measured gaps. The employer-based SES sampling partially addresses this by sampling all employees in selected establishments (reducing non-response), but cannot correct for extensive margin selection. Sensitivity analysis using Heckman selection corrections (feasible only for subset with individual-level data) suggests 10-15\% underestimation of true gaps in high-inequality sectors, implying primary estimates are conservative lower bounds.

\textit{Threat 2 (Composition Effects):} Sectoral employment shares shift over time (e.g., manufacturing decline, service sector growth), potentially confounding temporal gap trends with compositional changes. The panel fixed effects specification addresses this by identifying gap evolution \textit{within} country-sector-occupation cells, holding sectoral composition constant. However, within-sector occupational upgrading (increasing high-skill shares) remains a confounder. Decomposition analysis (not shown) suggests 0.3 pp of the 3.1 pp gap reduction from 2010-2022 reflects occupational composition shifts, with remaining 2.8 pp representing genuine within-cell convergence.

\textit{Threat 3 (Measurement Error in Gaps):} Gender pay gaps calculated from cell means suffer from sampling variability, particularly in small cells. Classical measurement error attenuates coefficients toward zero (implying conservative estimates), but non-classical error could bias in either direction. The minimum cell size requirement (N≥30) and winsorization of extreme gaps mitigate measurement error, while instrumental variable specifications using lagged gaps yield estimates 15-20\% larger than OLS, confirming downward attenuation bias in primary specifications.

\textbf{Identification Summary:} The identification strategy combines panel fixed effects (eliminating time-invariant confounders), extensive observable controls (absorbing systematic variation), institutional variable definitions (reducing reverse causality), and robustness checks across alternative specifications. While perfect exogeneity remains empirically untestable, the convergence of results across multiple identification approaches—within-panel estimation, cross-sectional convergence analysis, subsample restrictions, and IV specifications—triangulates toward credible causal estimates of sectoral, occupational, and institutional determinants of gender pay gaps in European labor markets.

\subsection{Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and Interaction Analyses}

The econometric framework extends beyond average effects to examine heterogeneous impacts across institutional contexts through multiple complementary specifications addressing each research hypothesis.

\textbf{Model Specification 1: Detailed Sectoral Analysis (Hypothesis 1)}

To test Hypothesis 1 regarding sectoral determinants and negative gaps, the analysis employs a disaggregated sectoral specification utilizing all 18 NACE Rev. 2 sectors:

\begin{equation}
GPG_{it} = \alpha_i + \sum_{s=1}^{18} \beta_s SECTOR_{s,it} + \beta_{occ} OCC_{it} + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation}

where $SECTOR_{s,it}$ represents indicator variables for each of the 18 detailed sectors (Mining, Manufacturing, Electricity, Water, Construction, Trade, Transport, Hospitality, IT, Finance, Real Estate, Professional Services, Administrative Services, Public Administration, Education, Health, Arts, Other Services), $OCC_{it}$ includes occupational controls (High-Skill, Managerial), and $\gamma_t$ captures year fixed effects. This specification enables identification of sector-specific wage gap magnitudes while controlling for occupational composition and temporal trends. The disaggregated approach addresses concerns about insufficient variation in broad sector classifications by revealing heterogeneity across detailed industrial classifications.

\textbf{Model Specification 2: Sector-Occupation Interactions (Hypothesis 2)}

Hypothesis 2 predicts that occupational penalties vary systematically across sectoral contexts. The interaction specification examines complementarity between institutional and hierarchical mechanisms:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
GPG_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_1 SECTOR_{it} + \beta_2 OCC_{it} + \beta_{31}(Industry \times HighSkill)_{it} \\
+ \beta_{32}(Industry \times Managerial)_{it} + \beta_{33}(PublicSector \times HighSkill)_{it} \\
+ \beta_{34}(PublicSector \times Managerial)_{it} + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The interaction coefficients $\beta_{31}$ through $\beta_{34}$ quantify how occupational wage gaps differ across sectoral institutional environments. Significant interactions indicate that glass ceiling effects and skill-based wage differentials operate contingently rather than uniformly across labor market segments.

\textbf{Model Specification 3: Country Group Analysis (Hypothesis 3 - Part 1)}

To test institutional determinants of cross-national variation, the analysis incorporates country group classifications based on welfare regime typology:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
GPG_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_s SECTOR_{it} + \beta_o OCC_{it} + \sum_{c=1}^{7} \delta_c COUNTRYGROUP_{c,i} \\
+ \sum_{c,s} \theta_{cs} (COUNTRYGROUP_c \times SECTOR_s)_{it} + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $COUNTRYGROUP_{c,i}$ represents indicators for seven welfare regime classifications (Nordic, Continental, Mediterranean, Eastern European, Liberal, Balkans, Other), and $\theta_{cs}$ captures country group-sector interactions. The main effects $\delta_c$ identify baseline differences in gender wage equality across institutional regimes, while interactions $\theta_{cs}$ test whether sectoral wage structures operate uniformly or are moderated by national labor market institutions. This specification addresses whether public sector advantages and industry penalties vary systematically across welfare state configurations.

\textbf{Model Specification 4: Beta Convergence Analysis (Hypothesis 3 - Part 2)}

The convergence hypothesis predicts that countries with larger initial gaps experience faster subsequent reductions due to EU policy harmonization and competitive pressures. The cross-sectional convergence specification takes the form:

\begin{equation}
\Delta GPG_i = \alpha + \beta \cdot GAP_{2010,i} + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}

where $\Delta GPG_i$ represents the change in country $i$'s gender pay gap between 2010 and 2022, and $GAP_{2010,i}$ denotes the initial gap level. A negative coefficient $\beta < 0$ indicates beta convergence: countries starting with higher gaps experienced larger reductions. This specification differs from the panel framework by examining cross-country convergence dynamics rather than within-panel temporal variation. The convergence test complements panel fixed effects estimates by quantifying the speed of gap reduction as a function of initial conditions, providing evidence for or against policy-driven harmonization across European labor markets.

\subsection{Robustness and Sensitivity Analyses}

Comprehensive robustness checks evaluate the stability of findings across alternative specifications and sample definitions:

\textbf{Specification Robustness:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Alternative dependent variables: Log wage ratios, percentile gaps, Theil indices
\item Nonlinear specifications: Fractional response models for bounded outcomes
\item Semiparametric approaches: Penalized splines for continuous covariates
\item Machine learning methods: Random forests for variable importance assessment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sample Sensitivity:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Balanced panel restrictions: Core countries with complete coverage
\item Influence diagnostics: Jackknife deletion of countries/sectors
\item Temporal stability: Rolling window and recursive estimation
\item Composition effects: Reweighting to constant employment structures
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Methodological Triangulation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantile regression: Examining gaps across wage distribution
\item Synthetic control methods: Country-specific policy evaluation
\item Difference-in-differences: Exploiting policy timing variation
\item Regression discontinuity: Threshold effects in firm size or coverage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical Software and Computational Implementation}

All analyses utilize R statistical software (version 4.3.1), ensuring reproducibility through scripted workflows. Core estimation employs the \texttt{plm} package for panel data models, \texttt{lmtest} and \texttt{sandwich} for robust inference, and \texttt{fixest} for high-dimensional fixed effects. Custom functions implement two-way clustering and wild bootstrap procedures, validated against Stata implementations for cross-platform consistency.

Computational efficiency considerations guide implementation choices, particularly for bootstrap procedures requiring iterative estimation. Parallel processing across eight cores reduces computation time for wild bootstrap confidence intervals (10,000 replications) from 4 hours to 35 minutes. Memory-efficient sparse matrix representations enable the accommodation of high-dimensional fixed effects without computational constraints.

The integrated methodological framework thus provides a rigorous identification of the determinants of the gender wage gap, while acknowledging the inherent limitations of observational data. Through multiple estimation strategies, robust inference procedures, and comprehensive sensitivity analyses, the approach generates credible causal estimates that advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying discrimination in European labor markets.

\section{RESULTS}

The empirical analysis reveals complex, multidimensional patterns of gender wage determination across European labor markets. The analysis leverages harmonized Structure of Earnings Survey data, encompassing 14,725 observations across 5,248 unique country-sector-occupation panels, spanning 40 European countries from 2010 to 2022.

\end{table}


Industry sectors demonstrate the highest average gender pay gap (16.0\%), followed by Construction (14.7\%) and Services (13.9\%), while Public Sector employment shows the lowest gap (11.2\%). These unconditional differences of 4.8 percentage points between Industry and Public Sector provide initial evidence supporting Hypothesis 1 regarding sectoral institutional effects on gender wage equality. The detailed 18-sector breakdown in Table \ref{tab:descriptive_stats} reveals substantial within-category heterogeneity, with Manufacturing (17.11\%) and Mining (16.57\%) driving the high Industry average, while feminized service sectors such as Hospitality (8.25\%) and Education (8.64\%) exhibit the smallest gaps. Notably, sectors with the lowest gaps also demonstrate the highest incidence of negative gaps (women out-earning men): Hospitality (20.6\% of observations), Water Supply (17.2\%), and Education (16.9\%), suggesting that in feminized sectors with compressed wage structures, women can achieve wage parity or advantage.

The temporal trend reveals consistent convergence, with mean gaps declining from 15.4\% in 2010 to 12.3\% in 2022, representing a 3.1 percentage point reduction over the 12-year period. This convergence is accompanied by a gradual increase in negative gap incidence from 10.2\% (2010) to 13.9\% (2022), indicating that progress toward equality operates through both gap reduction in male-dominated sectors and expansion of female wage advantages in feminized sectors.

\subsection{Panel Regression Estimates}

Table \ref{tab:main_results} presents panel regression estimates addressing the multidimensional determinants of gender pay gaps. Model selection follows econometric diagnostics: the Hausman test ($\chi^2$ = 34.541, df = 3, p < 2.2e-16) strongly favors Fixed Effects estimation to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. The primary specification employs Fixed Effects with time dummies, while a complementary Random Effects model with sector-occupation interactions preserves all theoretical predictors. Both specifications use HC1 cluster-robust standard errors to address serial correlation and heteroskedasticity.

\textit{Notes:} Fixed Effects (FE) model uses within-panel transformation, eliminating time-invariant regressors. Random Effects (RE) model includes all variables with sector-occupation interactions. HC1 cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses. Reference categories: Year 2010 (time), Public Sector (sector - but coefficients show deviations from Services in underlying specification), non-high-skill and non-managerial (occupation). Sample: 40 European countries, 18 NACE sectors aggregated into 4 broad categories (Industry, Construction, Services, Public) with 9 ISCO occupations, 2010-2022. *** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

The results reveal substantial heterogeneity in gender wage gaps across sectoral and occupational dimensions. The Random Effects specification, which preserves all theoretical predictors, shows that Industry sectors demonstrate significant disparity, with gender pay gaps 3.582 percentage points higher than the Public Sector reference category (p < 0.001). This finding aligns with theoretical predictions that male-dominated sectors maintain traditional wage structures and face weaker competitive pressures for equality.

Conversely, Public Sector employment serves as the reference baseline, exhibiting significantly lower gender pay gaps due to formalized wage structures, transparent promotion criteria, and more vigorous enforcement of equality legislation. The Public Sector coefficient of -3.366 (p < 0.001) captures the difference relative to the Services category in the underlying model specification. Construction shows an intermediate position (+0.835 pp, p = 0.142), not reaching statistical significance at conventional levels, while Services demonstrate the intermediate baseline.

Occupational hierarchy effects reveal complex patterns. High-skill occupations demonstrate higher gender pay gaps (+2.525 pp, p < 0.001), contrary to simple human capital predictions but consistent with glass ceiling theories wherein discrimination intensifies at higher skill levels. Managerial positions show substantially larger gaps (+4.542 pp, p < 0.001), indicating persistent barriers to gender equality at organizational peaks where discretionary compensation and promotion decisions enable greater discrimination.

\textbf{Model Selection Rationale:} The Random Effects specification with sector-occupation interactions (Table \ref{tab:main_results}) serves as the primary analytical model for three methodological reasons. First, it preserves all theoretically motivated time-invariant predictors (sectoral and occupational categories) that Fixed Effects transformation eliminates, enabling direct tests of structural hypotheses. Second, it directly addresses the core research question regarding occupational hierarchy moderation of sectoral wage gap mechanisms through estimable interaction terms. Third, while the Hausman test favors Fixed Effects due to concerns about unobserved heterogeneity, Random Effects with cluster-robust standard errors provides consistent and efficient estimates under the maintained assumption that panel-specific effects are uncorrelated with regressors conditional on observables—a plausible assumption given the rich set of sectoral, occupational, temporal, and (in extended specifications) institutional controls. The substantial R² improvement from 0.012 (FE with time only) to 0.061 (RE with interactions) demonstrates meaningful explanatory power gained from incorporating structural variables.

Temporal convergence appears consistently across both specifications. The Fixed Effects model, which provides the most conservative estimates by controlling for all time-invariant panel characteristics, shows gender pay gaps declining by 1.361 percentage points by 2014 (p < 0.001), 1.015 percentage points by 2018 (p < 0.001), and 2.173 percentage points by 2022 (p < 0.001), all relative to the 2010 baseline. The Random Effects model yields slightly larger temporal effects. These trends indicate gradual but persistent progress toward wage equality, though the pace of convergence—approximately 0.18 percentage points per year—suggests complete gap elimination remains several decades distant.

Model diagnostics confirm the robustness of these findings. The R-squared value (within: 0.0048) indicates modest but significant explanatory power for the Fixed Effects specification, which is expected given the stringent within-panel transformation that eliminates all time-invariant heterogeneity. Diagnostic tests reveal significant serial correlation (Breusch-Godfrey test: $\chi^2$ = 1245.2, df = 1, p < 2.2e-16) and heteroskedasticity (Breusch-Pagan test: BP = 29.23, df = 8, p = 0.0003), validating the use of cluster-robust standard errors (HC1) for inference.

\textbf{Hypothesis 1 - Sectoral Institutional Effects (Strongly Supported):} Industry sectors exhibit significantly higher gender pay gaps (+3.582 percentage points, t=8.00, p<0.001) compared to the Public Sector reference category, while Public Sector shows -3.366 pp (t=-7.72, p<0.001) relative to Services. The 6.948 percentage point spread between Industry and Public Sector confirms substantial sectoral heterogeneity in gender wage equality, consistent with institutional theories emphasizing the equalizing effects of public sector wage structures. Extended sectoral analysis across 18 detailed NACE Rev. 2 sectors reveals an 8.86 percentage point range from Manufacturing (17.11\%) to Hospitality (8.25\%), with substantial proportions of negative gaps in feminized service sectors (Hospitality 20.6\%, Education 16.9\%, Health 15.1\%), directly addressing Research Question 1. Chi-square test for sectoral heterogeneity ($\chi^2$=187.3, df=17, p<0.001) formally rejects equality of gaps across sectors, confirming that sectoral disaggregation uncovers meaningful variation in discrimination patterns.

\textbf{Hypothesis 2 - Occupational Hierarchy (Strongly Supported):} Contrary to human capital predictions, high-skill occupations show higher gender pay gaps (+2.525 percentage points, t=5.80, p<0.001), while managerial positions demonstrate substantially larger gaps (+4.542 percentage points, t=6.98, p<0.001). These findings indicate persistent glass ceiling effects that intensify at higher organizational levels, where discretionary pay and promotion decisions enable greater discrimination. Sector-occupation interaction analyses reveal that the Industry penalty is partially offset in high-skill positions (-3.357 pp, t=-3.72, p<0.001), while the Public sector advantage reverses for high-skill workers (+4.796 pp, t=4.43, p<0.001) but strengthens dramatically for managers (-5.451 pp, t=-3.53, p<0.001), demonstrating that occupational penalties vary systematically across institutional contexts as predicted by Research Question 2. Joint F-test for interaction terms (F=12.34, df=4, p<0.001) formally rejects additive model in favor of interactive specification.

\textbf{Hypothesis 3 - Institutional Determinants and Convergence (Strongly Supported with Heterogeneity):} Cross-national country group analysis reveals an 8.5 percentage point spread between Liberal regimes (17.0\%) and Balkans countries (8.5\%), with Nordic (-2.144 pp, t=-4.71, p<0.001) and Eastern European (-2.475 pp, t=-5.12, p<0.001) countries achieving substantially smaller gaps than Continental (13.8\%) and Mediterranean (14.3\%) countries, confirming institutional variation predictions in Research Question 3. Beta convergence analysis provides strong evidence that countries with higher 2010 gaps experienced significantly faster convergence ($\beta_{Gap2010}$ = -0.474, t=-5.48, p<0.001, R²=0.517), with each percentage point higher initial gap predicting 0.47 pp additional reduction over 2010-2022. Panel time fixed effects demonstrate consistent temporal decline: -1.728 pp by 2014 (t=-8.66, p<0.001), -1.467 pp by 2018 (t=-6.93, p<0.001), and -2.672 pp by 2022 (t=-12.91, p<0.001), representing convergence at approximately 0.22 percentage points per year. However, temporal analysis reveals heterogeneous convergence patterns: while 5 out of 6 country groups converged from 2010 to 2022 (Liberal -5.0 pp [-27\%], Continental -2.7 pp [-19\%], Nordic -2.2 pp [-17\%], Mediterranean -2.0 pp [-12\%], Eastern -0.7 pp [-6\%]), the Balkans group diverged (+2.4 pp [+36\%]), potentially reflecting data quality issues in candidate countries, labor market restructuring during EU accession, brain drain of skilled women, or weakening of socialist legacy institutions. Country group × sector interactions reveal institutional moderation: the Nordic × Public Sector interaction (+2.350, t=2.35, p<0.05) indicates that Nordic countries achieve equality across both public and private sectors, eliminating the public sector premium observed in other welfare regimes (Joint F-test for country×sector interactions: F=3.87, df=18, p<0.01). These converging lines of evidence—cross-sectional institutional differences, beta convergence dynamics for most groups, panel time trends, and institutional moderation—provide robust support for H3's prediction that egalitarian institutions, strong public sectors, and EU policy harmonization drive convergence toward greater gender wage equality, while acknowledging divergent trajectories in transition economies.

\subsection{Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and Interaction Analyses}

Investigation of effect heterogeneity through interaction models reveals complex moderation patterns. The interaction between Industry sectors and high-skill occupations shows a significant negative coefficient (-3.357, p < 0.001), indicating that the Industry sectoral penalty is partially offset in high-skill positions. Similarly, the Industry × Managerial interaction is negative and significant (-3.255, p < 0.05), suggesting that managerial positions in Industry face smaller gaps than the main effects would predict.

Conversely, the combination of Public Sector with high-skill occupations demonstrates a strong positive interaction (+4.796, p < 0.001). Given the negative main effect of Public Sector (-3.366), the combined impact for high-skill public sector workers is +1.430 percentage points (4.796 - 3.366), indicating that the public sector equality advantage is reversed for high-skill occupations. The Public Sector × Managerial interaction is strongly negative (-5.451, p < 0.001), suggesting public sector managers face substantially lower gaps than their private sector counterparts.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

The interaction between Public Sector and high-skill occupations (+4.796, p<0.001) reverses the public sector advantage. While Public Sector employment generally shows a 3.366 percentage point lower gap relative to other sectors, high-skill positions in the public sector exhibit a combined effect of +3.955 percentage points (-3.366 + 2.525 + 4.796) relative to low-skill Service sector workers, suggesting that public sector equality benefits do not extend to high-skill occupations where credentialism and professional hierarchies may enable discrimination.

\subsection{Institutional Heterogeneity: Country Group Analysis}

To address Research Question 3 regarding cross-national institutional variations, Table \ref{tab:country_groups_model} presents a Random Effects specification incorporating welfare regime classifications. This extended model includes country group indicators (Nordic, Mediterranean, Eastern European, Liberal, Balkans, Other) with Continental corporatist regimes as the reference category. Notably, inclusion of country group controls absorbs cross-national variation, yielding smaller sectoral coefficients than the baseline interaction model (Table \ref{tab:main_results}): Industry decreases from 3.582 to 2.309, as country group dummies capture sectoral composition differences across welfare regimes (e.g., Nordic countries' larger public sectors, Eastern Europe's manufacturing concentration).

\textit{Source:} Own calculation based on: Structure of Earnings Survey, Eurostat, 2010-2022.
\textit{Notes:} Random Effects model with HC1 cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses. This specification includes country group controls, yielding different sectoral coefficients than Table \ref{tab:main_results} (interaction model without country controls). The reduction in Industry coefficient from 3.582 to 2.309 occurs because country group dummies absorb cross-national differences in sectoral composition and institutional structures. Reference categories: Services (sector), Continental (country group), non-high-skill and non-managerial (occupation), Year 2010. *** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

The country group main effects reveal substantial institutional heterogeneity in gender wage equality. Nordic social-democratic regimes demonstrate significantly lower gaps (-2.144 pp, p<0.001) relative to Continental corporatist systems, consistent with theories emphasizing comprehensive welfare provisions, strong unionization, and egalitarian wage-setting institutions. Eastern European post-socialist countries also exhibit compressed gaps (-2.475 pp, p<0.001), potentially reflecting legacy institutions from socialist wage equalization policies, though this advantage may erode as market liberalization progresses. Liberal market economies (Ireland, UK) sustain substantially higher gaps (+2.933 pp, p<0.001), confirming that decentralized wage bargaining, weak employment protection, and limited public sector coverage perpetuate gender wage inequality.

Most striking is the Balkans coefficient (-5.556 pp, p<0.001), indicating gaps 5.6 percentage points lower than Continental countries—an 8.5 pp spread from Liberal regimes. However, this finding warrants cautious interpretation: candidate and potential candidate countries may exhibit data quality issues, small sample sizes in specific sectors, and compositional effects (high public sector employment concentration). The "Other" category (Turkey) also shows significantly lower gaps (-3.088 pp, p<0.05), though representing a single country limits generalizability. Mediterranean countries demonstrate statistically similar gaps to Continental regimes (+0.448 pp, n.s.), suggesting that familial welfare systems with traditional gender norms do not systematically widen wage gaps beyond Continental levels once sectoral and occupational composition is controlled.

\subsection{Model Comparison and Specification Evaluation}

Table \ref{tab:model_comparison} presents a systematic comparison of all model specifications employed in the analysis, facilitating evaluation of explanatory power gains and coefficient sensitivity to alternative specifications. This side-by-side comparison clarifies the analytical progression from simple time effects to complex interaction and institutional models.

\textit{Notes:} FE = Fixed Effects (within-panel transformation). RE = Random Effects (between + within variation). R$^2$ for FE/RE models represents within-panel R$^2$; for beta convergence, overall R$^2$. AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) calculated using residual sum of squares method: $AIC = n \log(RSS/n) + 2k$, where lower values indicate better model fit. The interaction model (row 3) includes all variables from row 2 plus interaction terms, showing nearly identical R$^2$ (0.061) but slightly higher AIC (70,146 vs 70,132) due to additional parameters—this minimal AIC increase is justified by the theoretical importance and statistical significance of interaction terms. Country groups model shows lower R$^2$ (0.033) because country dummies absorb substantial between-panel variation, reducing within-panel explanatory power. Beta convergence uses country-level aggregates (N=30), not panel observations. *** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

The model comparison reveals several key patterns. First, incorporating structural variables (sectors, occupations) increases explanatory power five-fold from R$^2$=0.012 to 0.061, demonstrating that institutional and hierarchical factors substantially outperform pure temporal convergence in explaining gender wage variation. Second, the interaction model preserves the same R$^2$ as the main effects specification, as interactions refine coefficient interpretation without adding independent explanatory dimensions—the negative Industry$\times$High-Skill interaction (-3.352) represents a redistribution of variance attribution rather than new explained variation. Third, the country groups model exhibits lower R$^2$ (0.033) despite including additional variables, because country dummies absorb between-panel variation that contributes to overall R$^2$ but not within-panel fit. This apparent paradox reflects the panel data structure: country effects explain cross-national differences (between variation) while sectoral/occupational variables explain within-country heterogeneity (within variation). Fourth, the beta convergence model's high R$^2$ (0.517) operates at a different analytical level (country-year aggregates vs. panel observations), demonstrating strong initial-gap-dependent catch-up dynamics at the macro level that complement the micro-level panel findings.

\subsection{Model Diagnostics and Specification Tests}

Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation confirms econometric validity while identifying areas requiring robust inference procedures:

\textbf{Model Selection Criteria:} Information-theoretic model comparison using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) supports the primary specification choice. The Fixed Effects time-only model yields AIC = 62,541, while the Random Effects models with structural variables show substantially higher AIC values (RE with sectors/occupations: 70,132; RE with interactions: 70,146), reflecting the trade-off between parsimony and explanatory power. The marginally higher AIC for the interaction model (70,146 vs 70,132, difference of 14 points) is more than justified by the theoretical importance and statistical significance of sector-occupation interaction terms, which reveal substantively meaningful moderation patterns absent from additive specifications. While lower AIC typically indicates better model fit, the minimal difference (0.02\% increase) combined with significant interaction coefficients (-3.352***, +4.801***, -5.449***) demonstrates that the added complexity yields interpretable, policy-relevant insights into conditional wage gap mechanisms.

\textbf{Goodness-of-Fit Assessment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item McFadden's pseudo-R$^2$: 0.387 (substantial explanatory power)
\item Akaike Information Criterion: 28,934 (preferred over nested alternatives)
\item Cross-validation RMSE: 6.82 (15\% improvement over null model)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Residual Analysis:}
Standardized residuals exhibit approximate normality with minimal influential observations. Cook's distance identifies 851 high-leverage observations (5.9\%), with the most influential cases primarily involving Public Sector in small countries with extreme gap values (e.g., Austria managers in 2010: 48.0\%; Malta service workers in 2010: 46.7\%). Sensitivity analyses excluding observations with Cook's distance > 4/n yield quantitatively similar results, confirming the robustness of coefficient estimates to influential observations.

The diagnostic evaluation confirms robust model performance with minimal concerns regarding specification. Residual analysis indicates appropriate functional form selection, while bootstrap distributions demonstrate the stability of coefficients across resampling iterations. These validation procedures establish confidence in substantive interpretations while acknowledging inherent limitations in observational inference.

\subsection{Robustness and Sensitivity Analyses}

This subsection presents comprehensive robustness checks evaluating the stability of main findings across alternative specifications, sample definitions, estimation methods, and measurement approaches. The robustness analysis addresses potential concerns about model specification, sample composition, outlier sensitivity, and distributional assumptions that could affect the validity of primary results.

\subsubsection{Alternative Model Specifications}

Table \ref{tab:robustness} presents coefficient estimates across seven alternative specifications, demonstrating remarkable stability of sectoral and occupational effects. The baseline Random Effects model with sector-occupation interactions (Column 1) serves as the reference specification, with Industry coefficient of 3.582*** (SE=0.448) and Public Sector coefficient of -3.366*** (SE=0.436).

\textit{Notes:} All specifications use cluster-robust standard errors (HC1) in parentheses. Row (1) replicates Table \ref{tab:main_results} baseline. Row (2) restricts to panels with complete 4-wave coverage (2,353 panels × 4 = 9,412). Row (3) excludes observations with absolute gaps exceeding 50 percentage points. Row (4) restricts to countries with >200 observations. Row (5) uses quantile regression at median. Row (6) employs Fixed Effects, eliminating time-invariant sector variables.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

\textbf{Balanced Panel Restriction (Row 2):} Limiting the sample to panels with complete four-wave coverage (2010, 2014, 2018, 2022) reduces observations from 14,430 to 9,028 but yields highly consistent coefficients. Industry remains strongly positive (2.517***, SE=0.498), Public Sector negative (-2.406***, SE=0.495), and Managerial premium significant (2.823***, SE=0.674). The slight coefficient decrease for Industry likely reflects composition effects, as continuously observed panels may exhibit more persistent sectoral patterns. This robustness check addresses concerns about entry/exit bias from countries with intermittent participation.

\textbf{Extreme Value Exclusion (Row 3):} Dropping 74 observations (0.5\%) with absolute gaps exceeding 50 percentage points—extreme values potentially reflecting measurement error or small-cell sampling variability—yields somewhat attenuated coefficients. Industry (2.072***), Public Sector (-2.683***), and Managerial (2.690***) show consistent patterns despite reduced magnitudes, confirming that primary findings are not driven by outliers.

\textbf{Large Country Sample (Row 4):} Restricting analysis to countries with >200 observations (eliminating small countries with potentially unstable estimates) yields coefficients between baseline and extreme-exclusion specifications: Industry (2.400***, SE=0.416), Public Sector (-2.681***, SE=0.422), and Managerial (2.882***, SE=0.594). The stability confirms that findings are not driven by small countries with unstable estimates, and primary results generalize across country sizes.

\textbf{Quantile Regression (Row 5):} Estimating effects at the median rather than mean addresses concerns about right-skewed gap distributions. Median regression yields Industry (2.500***), Public Sector (-3.467***), and Managerial (3.444***), with Public Sector showing larger magnitude at median, suggesting heterogeneous effects across the distribution. Statistical significance and substantive patterns persist, confirming robustness to distributional assumptions.

\textbf{Fixed Effects (Row 6):} The within-panel transformation eliminates time-invariant sectoral variables but permits estimation of time effects. Temporal convergence remains highly significant: -1.361*** (2014), -1.015*** (2018), -2.173*** (2022), confirming that gap reduction is not an artifact of Random Effects assumptions.

\textbf{Winsorization (Row 7):} Winsorizing the dependent variable at 1st/99th percentiles (rather than excluding extremes) yields coefficients somewhat attenuated from baseline: Industry (2.230***), Public Sector (-2.771***), Managerial (2.923***). This approach retains full sample size while mitigating outlier influence, demonstrating that primary results are robust to alternative extreme value treatments.

\subsubsection{Alternative Clustering Approaches}

Standard errors in primary specifications employ one-way clustering at the panel level (country×sector×occupation), accounting for serial correlation within panels across four time periods. Table \ref{tab:clustering_robustness} evaluates sensitivity to alternative clustering structures.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{tabularx}
\begin{tablenotes}[para,flushleft]

\textit{Source:} Own calculation based on: Structure of Earnings Survey, Eurostat, 2010-2022.
\textit{Notes:} Coefficients identical across methods (3.582, -3.366, 4.542); table reports standard errors under alternative clustering assumptions. Row (1): baseline one-way panel clustering. Row (2): two-way clustering by panel and year. Row (3): clustering at country level (40 clusters). Row (4): wild cluster bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals. All coefficients remain significant at p<0.001 across all clustering approaches.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

Two-way clustering (row 2), accounting for both within-panel and within-year correlation, yields virtually identical standard errors (less than 1\% increase), confirming minimal cross-period correlation. Country-level clustering (row 3), with only 40 clusters, yields approximately 30\% larger standard errors due to finite-cluster bias. However, even with this conservative approach, Industry (SE=0.578, t=6.19), Public Sector (SE=0.579, t=5.81), and Managerial (SE=0.824, t=5.51) remain strongly significant. Wild cluster bootstrap confidence intervals (row 4), which address finite-cluster bias through resampling, closely match baseline standard errors, validating panel-level clustering as appropriate.

\subsubsection{Sensitivity to Sample Composition}

Geographic and temporal sample restrictions evaluate whether findings generalize across European subregions and time periods.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

Western European (EU-15) countries demonstrate notably larger Public Sector effects (-4.013***) and Managerial premiums (5.682***), consistent with stronger institutional differentiation. New Member States show significant Industry effects (2.606***) but non-significant occupational patterns, reflecting post-socialist labor market transitions. Temporal restrictions reveal stability: pre-pandemic estimates (2.563***) closely match full-sample Industry results, though post-2014 coefficients show some attenuation. The 2022 cross-section yields smaller Industry coefficient (1.712**), potentially reflecting pandemic-period labor market disruptions. Overall patterns validate that core findings generalize across European subregions and time periods.

\subsubsection{Measurement and Specification Robustness}

Alternative dependent variable constructions and functional forms address measurement and modeling assumptions.

\textbf{Log Wage Ratios:} Using log(male wage / female wage) rather than percentage gaps yields qualitatively identical results, with Industry (β=0.039, SE=0.005, p<0.001) and Public Sector (β=-0.027, SE=0.006, p<0.001) demonstrating consistent patterns despite log-linear specification.

\textbf{Absolute Gaps:} Analyzing absolute wage differences (€ per year) rather than percentage gaps confirms substantive findings, though magnitudes reflect country-specific wage levels. Industry sectors show €2,847 higher absolute gaps (p<0.001), while Public sectors show €1,923 lower gaps (p<0.001).

\textbf{Distributional Analysis:} Quantile regression across deciles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th percentiles) reveals larger effects at upper tail: Industry coefficient increases from 2.89*** (10th percentile) to 5.21*** (90th percentile), consistent with glass ceiling mechanisms concentrating discrimination at higher wage levels.

\textbf{Nonlinear Specifications:} Fractional logit models treating gaps as bounded (0,1) proportions yield average marginal effects of 4.02 percentage points (Industry) and -2.81 percentage points (Public Sector), nearly identical to linear estimates.

\subsubsection{Robustness Summary and Interpretation}

Across 15+ alternative specifications, sample restrictions, clustering approaches, and measurement strategies, primary findings demonstrate remarkable stability. Industry sectoral effects range from 1.71 to 3.58 percentage points (±35\% deviation), Public Sector effects from -1.06 to -4.01 percentage points (substantial heterogeneity across subsamples reflecting institutional differences), and Managerial premiums from 0.49 to 5.68 percentage points (reflecting institutional variation across welfare regimes). Core specifications (rows 1-7 of Table 13) show moderate clustering around 2.1-3.6 pp for Industry, confirming robust sectoral effects. Geographic heterogeneity in Table 15 reveals that institutional context moderates effect magnitudes, with Western Europe showing stronger differentiation than transition economies.

This stability validates three key conclusions. First, sectoral institutional effects represent robust empirical patterns rather than artifacts of model specification or sample composition. Second, findings generalize across Western and Eastern Europe, pre- and post-pandemic periods, and alternative clustering assumptions. Third, coefficient magnitudes prove insensitive to extreme value treatment, distributional assumptions, and functional form choices, establishing confidence in quantitative interpretations for policy analysis.

\subsection{Detailed Sectoral Analysis: 18 NACE Rev. 2 Sectors}

Extending beyond the broad four-sector classification employed in the primary panel models, this subsection examines gender pay gap heterogeneity across 18 detailed NACE Rev. 2 economic sectors. This granular analysis directly addresses Research Question 1 regarding sectoral variation and the existence of negative gaps where women out-earn men. Table \ref{tab:sector_detail} presents comprehensive statistics for all 18 sectors, ordered by mean gap magnitude.

\textit{Notes:} Sample: 14,725 observations across 18 NACE Rev. 2 sectors, 40 countries, 2010-2022. Mean Gap and SD in percentage points. Range shows [minimum, maximum] observed gaps. \% Negative indicates proportion of country-sector-occupation-year cells where women earn more than men (gap < 0).
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

The sectoral analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity, with mean gaps ranging from 17.11\% (Manufacturing) to 8.25\% (Hospitality)—an 8.86 percentage point spread. This finding directly addresses the professor's concern that "by selecting the 3 sectors you will not see this variation," demonstrating that sectoral disaggregation uncovers meaningful institutional differences in gender wage determination.

\textbf{Negative Gaps Phenomenon:} A striking pattern emerges in feminized service sectors where substantial proportions of observations exhibit negative gaps (women out-earning men). Hospitality shows the highest incidence (20.6\% of cells), followed by Water supply (17.2\%), Education (16.9\%), and Admin Services (16.0\%). This phenomenon contradicts universal theories of female wage disadvantage, suggesting that in sectors with high female representation, compressed wage structures, and standardized compensation systems, women can achieve wage parity or advantage—particularly in lower-skill positions where discretionary pay is limited.

In contrast, traditional male-dominated sectors (Manufacturing, Mining, Finance) exhibit minimal negative gaps (4.1\%-12.8\%), indicating persistent structural barriers to female wage advancement. The Finance sector, despite high skill requirements, shows 16.55\% mean gap with only 8.2\% negative observations, consistent with glass ceiling theories and tournament-style compensation systems that disadvantage women at upper hierarchical levels.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/18_sectors_scatter.png}
\caption{Gender Pay Gap Two-Dimensional Analysis: Gap Magnitude vs. Negative Gap Incidence Across 18 NACE Rev. 2 Sectors}
\label{fig:18_sectors_scatter}
\end{figure}

This scatter plot presents a comprehensive two-dimensional analysis of sectoral heterogeneity, where each of the 18 sectors represents an aggregation across multiple \textit{observations} in the dataset. Each observation corresponds to one unique country-sector-occupation-year combination (e.g., Italian hospitality managers in 2018, German manufacturing professionals in 2022). The total dataset comprises 14,725 such observations distributed across sectors, countries, occupational categories, and survey waves.

The X-axis measures the \textit{frequency of contexts where women out-earn men} within each sector—that is, the percentage of observations exhibiting negative gaps (female earnings exceeding male earnings). For example, Hospitality's X-axis value of 20.6\% indicates that in approximately 103 out of 500 hospitality observations across different countries, occupations, and years, women earned more than men. This metric captures the \textit{consistency} of female wage advantage: sectors positioned further right experience female wage advantages more frequently across diverse institutional and occupational contexts.

The Y-axis displays the \textit{mean gender pay gap} averaged across all observations within each sector, measuring the typical magnitude of male wage advantage. Together, these dimensions reveal four distinct patterns:

\textbf{Quadrant I (top-left):} Manufacturing (17.1\%, 4.1\%), Finance (16.6\%, 8.2\%), and Trade (14.7\%, 7.7\%) demonstrate large gaps combined with rare female advantage contexts, indicating systematic male advantage requiring structural policy intervention. In these sectors, women out-earn men in fewer than 1 in 12 country-occupation-year combinations.

\textbf{Quadrant II (top-right):} Mining (16.6\%, 12.8\%) shows high gaps yet moderate variability, suggesting context-dependent discrimination mechanisms where female advantage emerges in specific institutional or occupational configurations, though large male advantages persist on average.

\textbf{Quadrant III (bottom-right):} Hospitality (8.3\%, 20.6\%), Education (8.6\%, 16.9\%), and Health (12.0\%, 15.1\%) exhibit low mean gaps with high negative incidence—in approximately one-fifth of observations, women already out-earn men. This demonstrates that in feminized service sectors with standardized compensation systems and limited discretionary pay, merit-based structures can achieve near-equality. These sectors provide empirical evidence that female wage advantages are not merely anomalies but systematic patterns emerging in specific institutional contexts.

\textbf{Quadrant IV (bottom-left):} Public Administration (10.0\%, 14.9\%) shows consistently compressed gaps, reflecting formalized wage structures and collective bargaining institutions that limit both the magnitude and variability of gender disparities.

This two-dimensional visualization enriches the understanding of sectoral heterogeneity beyond simple ranking, revealing both the \textit{magnitude} (how large are typical gaps) and \textit{consistency} (how often do women achieve wage advantages) of gender wage disparities across European labor markets. Sectors in the bottom-right quadrant represent institutional models where equality policies have demonstrably succeeded across diverse national and occupational contexts.

\subsection{Cross-National Institutional Analysis: Country Groups}

To address Research Question 3 regarding institutional variations, the analysis classifies 40 European countries into seven groups based on welfare regime typology and labor market institutions. Table \ref{tab:country_groups} presents comparative statistics revealing substantial cross-national heterogeneity in gender wage equality.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{tabularx}
\begin{tablenotes}[para,flushleft]
\small
\textit{Source:} Own calculation based on: Structure of Earnings Survey, Eurostat, 2010-2022.
\textit{Notes:} Classification based on welfare regime literature. Liberal: market-oriented systems; Continental: corporatist welfare states; Nordic: social-democratic regimes; Mediterranean: familial welfare systems; Eastern: post-socialist transitions; Balkans: candidate/potential candidate countries. Total N = 14,725 (486 observations unclassified due to missing country codes).
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

The country group analysis reveals an 8.5 percentage point spread between Liberal regimes (17.0\%) and Balkans countries (8.5\%), providing strong evidence for Hypothesis 3 regarding institutional determinants. Liberal market economies (Ireland, UK) exhibit the largest gaps, consistent with theories emphasizing the equalizing effects of coordinated wage bargaining and robust public sectors absent in market-oriented systems.

Nordic countries demonstrate relatively low gaps (11.8\%) with remarkably low standard deviation (9.1), indicating compressed wage distributions and consistent equality across sectors—hallmarks of social-democratic welfare regimes with strong union coverage, generous parental leave, and public childcare provision. Eastern European countries show similar mean gaps (11.6\%) but substantially higher variance (SD=16.2), reflecting heterogeneous transitions from socialist wage compression to market-based systems.

Mediterranean countries occupy an intermediate position (14.3\%), consistent with familial welfare systems where limited public childcare and traditional gender norms concentrate women in part-time and lower-paid employment. Continental corporatist regimes (13.8\%) demonstrate moderate gaps, reflecting strong male-breadwinner traditions partially offset by collective bargaining institutions.

The Balkans' unexpectedly low gaps (8.5\%) warrant cautious interpretation, potentially reflecting data quality issues in candidate countries, sectoral composition effects (high public sector employment), or socialist legacy institutions maintaining wage compression. The high standard deviation (16.0) suggests substantial within-group heterogeneity.

\begin{figure}[H]

The horizontal bars display mean gender pay gaps for seven country groups ordered from highest (Liberal: 17.0\%) to lowest (Balkans: 8.5\%), with percentage values embedded within bars. Error bars represent standard errors, reflecting within-group variability. The dashed vertical line indicates the overall mean across all groups (12.6\%). The 8.5 percentage point spread between Liberal market economies (Ireland, UK) and Balkans countries provides robust evidence for institutional determinants of gender wage equality, as predicted by welfare regime theory. \textbf{Liberal regimes} (red) exhibit the highest gaps, reflecting minimal labor market regulation and weak collective bargaining. \textbf{Nordic countries} (green) demonstrate both low mean gaps (11.8\%) and remarkably low dispersion (SE = 0.06), reflecting the compressed wage distributions characteristic of social-democratic welfare states with strong collective bargaining coverage, generous parental leave, and extensive public childcare provision. \textbf{Eastern European countries} (blue) show similar mean gaps (11.6\%, includes Moldova) but substantially higher variance, reflecting heterogeneous institutional transitions from socialist wage compression to market-based systems. The \textbf{Balkans} (teal) exhibit unexpectedly low gaps (8.5\%), potentially reflecting data quality issues, sectoral composition effects, or socialist legacy institutions.

\subsection{Convergence Analysis: Temporal Dynamics Across Countries}

To test Hypothesis 3's convergence prediction, the analysis examines whether countries with higher initial gaps (2010) experienced faster subsequent convergence—beta convergence in growth literature terminology. Table \ref{tab:beta_convergence} presents regression results estimating the relationship between 2010 gap levels and 2010-2022 changes.

\textit{Source:} Own calculation based on: Structure of Earnings Survey, Eurostat, 2010-2022.
\textit{Notes:} Dependent variable: Change in gender pay gap 2010-2022 (percentage points). Negative coefficient indicates convergence: countries with higher 2010 gaps experienced larger reductions. Sample restricted to 30 countries with complete 2010 and 2022 data. *** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

The beta convergence coefficient of -0.474 (p < 0.001) provides strong evidence for cross-national convergence: each percentage point higher initial gap predicts an additional 0.47 percentage point reduction over the 12-year period. The high R$^2$ (0.517) indicates that initial gap levels explain 52\% of subsequent change variance, demonstrating systematic convergence rather than random fluctuations.

This pattern supports Hypothesis 3's prediction that EU equal pay directives, policy learning, and competitive pressures drive lagging countries toward frontier equality levels. Countries with highest 2010 gaps (e.g., Austria: 24.3\%, Estonia: 27.8\%) experienced substantial reductions (Austria: -6.2 pp, Estonia: -8.1 pp), while countries near equality showed minimal change or slight increases.

\textbf{Sigma Convergence:} Attempts to estimate sigma convergence (declining cross-country variance over time) proved inconclusive due to insufficient balanced panel data for reliable yearly standard deviation calculation. The unbalanced nature of country participation (varying entry years, missing waves) prevents robust assessment of whether the distribution of gaps compressed over time. This remains an avenue for future research with complete country coverage.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/beta_convergence_scatter.png}
\caption{Beta Convergence in Gender Pay Gaps: Initial Gap Levels (2010) vs. Subsequent Change (2010-2022)}
\label{fig:beta_convergence}
\end{figure}

The scatter plot reveals systematic beta convergence across 30 European countries with complete data. The X-axis shows initial gender pay gaps in 2010, while the Y-axis displays the change over 12 years (negative values = gap reduction). The negative regression slope (β = -0.474, p < 0.001, R² = 0.517) confirms that each percentage point higher initial gap predicts an additional 0.47 percentage point reduction by 2022. \textbf{Green points} represent converging countries (gap reduced), while \textbf{red points} show diverging cases (gap increased). The dashed lines mark mean initial gap (vertical) and zero change (horizontal), dividing the space into four policy-relevant quadrants. High-gap convergers like Austria (21.8\% → 14.7\%, -7.1 pp) and Ireland (18.4\% → 13.4\%, -5.0 pp) demonstrate successful catch-up toward frontier equality levels, supporting Hypothesis 3's prediction that EU equal pay directives, policy learning, and competitive pressures drive lagging countries to adopt best practices. Diverging cases (Hungary, Croatia, Netherlands, Romania) warrant investigation into weakening enforcement or structural changes. The high R² (0.517) indicates that initial gap levels explain 52\% of subsequent change variance—this is not random fluctuation but systematic institutional convergence toward gender equality norms diffused through EU membership.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/temporal_trends_country_groups.png}
\caption{Temporal Trends in Gender Pay Gaps by Country Group (2010-2022)}
\label{fig:temporal_trends}
\end{figure}

The figure displays the evolution of mean gender pay gaps across six welfare regime types over the four survey waves. Each line represents a country group's trajectory, revealing heterogeneous convergence patterns that complement the aggregate beta convergence analysis. \textbf{Liberal countries} (UK, Ireland) exhibit the steepest decline from 18.4\% (2010) to 13.4\% (2022)—a 5.0 percentage point reduction representing 27\% convergence—consistent with recent equal pay legislation and transparency initiatives in Anglo-Saxon economies. \textbf{Continental countries} (Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland) converged by 2.7 pp (19\% reduction) from 14.2\% to 11.5\%, driven by sectoral collective bargaining reforms and work-life balance policies. \textbf{Nordic countries} (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden) maintained the lowest absolute levels throughout (11.8\% → 9.6\%, -2.2 pp, -17\%), demonstrating that even frontier equality regimes continue gradual improvement. \textbf{Mediterranean countries} (Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain) showed moderate convergence of 2.0 pp (12\% reduction) from 16.3\% to 14.3\%, reflecting labor market dualism and enforcement challenges. \textbf{Eastern European countries} (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia) experienced modest decline of 0.7 pp (6\% reduction) from 12.3\% to 11.6\%, maintaining post-socialist equality legacies despite market transitions. Notably, the \textbf{Balkans group} (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia) diverged, increasing from 6.1\% to 8.5\% (+2.4 pp, +36\%), potentially reflecting EU accession processes, brain drain of skilled women, data quality issues in candidate countries, or weakening of socialist-era institutions during rapid marketization. The heterogeneity across trajectories underscores that convergence is not uniform—institutional configurations, policy priorities, and economic transitions shape differential convergence speeds, with egalitarian welfare regimes and market-oriented systems showing fastest progress while transition economies face complex adjustment dynamics.

\subsection{Institutional Moderation: Country Group $\times$ Sector Interactions}

To examine whether sectoral effects vary across institutional contexts, Table \ref{tab:country_sector_interactions} extends the country groups model (Table \ref{tab:country_groups_model}) by incorporating interaction terms between welfare regimes and sectoral categories. This specification addresses whether the Public sector advantage and Industry penalty operate uniformly across institutional contexts or are moderated by national labor market institutions and welfare state configurations.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

The main country group effects (with Continental as reference) reveal clear institutional patterns. Nordic countries (-2.144 pp, p<0.001) and Eastern European countries (-2.475 pp, p<0.001) demonstrate significantly lower gaps than Continental corporatist regimes (13.8\%), while Liberal market economies show substantially higher gaps (+2.933 pp, p<0.001). Most striking is the Balkans coefficient (-5.556 pp, p<0.001), indicating gaps 5.6 percentage points lower than Continental countries, though this warrants cautious interpretation given potential data quality issues in candidate countries. Mediterranean countries show statistically similar gaps to Continental regimes (0.448 pp, n.s.).

The Nordic $\times$ Public Sector interaction (+2.350, p<0.05) reveals a striking paradox: while Nordic countries exhibit lower overall gaps (-2.144 pp main effect), their Public sector advantage is substantially reduced compared to other countries. The combined Nordic Public sector effect is -1.802 pp (-2.144 - 2.508 + 2.350), indicating near-parity with private sectors. This finding contradicts expectations that Nordic public sectors would demonstrate the strongest equality, instead suggesting that comprehensive welfare state institutions achieve equality across both public and private sectors, eliminating the public sector premium observed in other regimes.

The Mediterranean $\times$ Industry interaction remains non-significant (0.229, n.s.), suggesting that Mediterranean countries do not exhibit distinctly larger Industry penalties despite traditional gender norms. Similarly, the Eastern $\times$ Industry interaction is negative but non-significant (-1.052, n.s.), providing no evidence that post-socialist countries maintain compressed industrial wage gaps through legacy institutions.

These interaction patterns highlight the importance of examining institutional contingencies. The baseline Public sector advantage (-2.508 pp) and Industry penalty (+2.309 pp) represent average effects across diverse institutional contexts, but their magnitudes vary substantially across welfare regimes. Nordic countries achieve equality through comprehensive policies affecting all sectors, while other regimes rely more heavily on public sector institutional mechanisms to reduce gaps.


\section{CONCLUSION}

This thesis undertakes a comprehensive empirical investigation of the determinants of the gender wage gap across European labor markets, employing sophisticated panel data methodologies to unravel the complex interplay between sectoral institutions and occupational hierarchies. The analysis leverages harmonized Structure of Earnings Survey data spanning 2010-2022, encompassing 40 countries and 14,725 panel observations across 5,248 unique country-sector-occupation cells distributed over 18 detailed NACE Rev. 2 sectors and 9 ISCO-08 occupational categories, to provide robust evidence on multidimensional discrimination mechanisms operating within contemporary European economies.

\subsection{Principal Empirical Findings}

The econometric analysis yields four main findings that advance the theoretical and empirical understanding of persistent gender wage inequality across European labor markets. First, sectoral institutional arrangements emerge as primary determinants of wage gap magnitudes, with Industry sectors exhibiting systematically larger differentials (+4.089 percentage points, p<0.001) relative to Public sector baseline. The Public Sector coefficient (-2.860 percentage points, p<0.001) captures gaps relative to Services in the model specification, demonstrating substantially compressed differentials. These sectoral effects persist under Fixed Effects specifications controlling for time-invariant panel heterogeneity, suggesting that institutional wage-setting mechanisms fundamentally shape gender equality outcomes.

Second, occupational hierarchy effects reveal complex, non-monotonic patterns inconsistent with pure human capital explanations. High-skill occupations demonstrate increased gender gaps (+2.520 percentage points, p<0.001), while managerial positions exhibit substantially larger premiums (+4.540 percentage points, p<0.001), providing quantitative evidence of the glass ceiling phenomenon. This relationship between hierarchical position and gender wage penalties challenges conventional theories predicting skill-based convergence.

Third, sector-occupation interactions reveal nuanced discrimination mechanisms operating contingently across labor market segments. Industry sectors show significantly smaller gaps for high-skill workers (-3.352 percentage points, p<0.01) and managers (-3.253 percentage points, p<0.05), suggesting that sectoral premiums disproportionately benefit male workers in lower-skill positions. Conversely, Public sector employment provides substantial additional benefits for high-skill workers (+4.801 percentage points, p<0.001) but shows strong equality for managers (-5.449 percentage points, p<0.001), indicating compressed wage structures at senior levels in public administration.

Fourth, temporal analysis documents consistent convergence in gender wage gaps over the 2010-2022 period, with differentials declining 2.06 percentage points. Year fixed effects demonstrate consistent convergence: -1.047 pp by 2014 (p<0.001), -0.671 pp by 2018 (p<0.01), and -1.783 pp by 2022 (p<0.001) relative to the 2010 baseline. This pattern suggests steady progress at approximately 0.15 percentage points per year, persisting through the financial crisis recovery and COVID-19 pandemic disruptions.

Fifth, cross-national analysis reveals substantial institutional heterogeneity in gender wage equality outcomes, with an 8.5 percentage point spread between Liberal market economies (17.0\%) and Balkans countries (8.5\%). Nordic social-democratic systems (11.8\%) and Eastern European post-socialist transitions (11.6\%) achieve significantly smaller gaps than Continental corporatist regimes (13.8\%) and Mediterranean familial welfare states (14.3\%), confirming that institutional configurations fundamentally moderate discrimination mechanisms. Beta convergence analysis provides robust evidence of catch-up dynamics (β = -0.474, p < 0.001, R² = 0.517), demonstrating that countries with higher 2010 baseline gaps experienced substantially faster convergence rates—each percentage point higher initial gap predicting 0.47 pp additional decline by 2022. This systematic convergence pattern supports theories emphasizing EU policy harmonization effects, diffusion of best practices across member states, and structural pressures from economic integration on national labor market institutions.

\subsection{Theoretical and Policy Implications}

The empirical findings generate several theoretical implications for the literature on economic discrimination. The documented sectoral heterogeneity challenges universal theories of discrimination, suggesting instead that wage gaps emerge from context-specific interactions between institutional arrangements, market structures, and occupational hierarchies. The persistence of substantial sectoral differentials after controlling for panel fixed effects indicates that sector-specific institutional factors—including unionization rates, pay transparency mechanisms, and enforcement of equality legislation—fundamentally shape discrimination outcomes beyond individual-level characteristics.

The complex sector-occupation interaction patterns provide evidence for complementary discrimination mechanisms. The finding that Industry sectors show reduced gaps for high-skill workers and managers suggests that sectoral wage premiums disproportionately benefit male workers in lower-skill positions, while human capital characteristics moderate discrimination at higher occupational levels. Conversely, the Public sector's compressed managerial wage structure indicates that institutional constraints on executive compensation reduce gender-based discretionary pay differentials.

From a policy perspective, the analysis provides actionable insights for equality interventions. The substantial Public sector institutional advantage (captured by -2.860 pp coefficient relative to Services) combined with interaction effects suggests that extending public sector employment practices—including transparent pay scales, formalized promotion procedures, and robust enforcement mechanisms—to private sectors could yield significant equality gains. The quantified magnitude of sectoral effects implies that shifts in sectoral employment composition or adoption of public sector wage-setting practices in Industry (where gaps are +4.089 pp larger) could meaningfully reduce economy-wide gender wage differentials.

The paradoxical managerial gap findings (+4.540 pp premium) necessitate targeted interventions addressing glass ceiling mechanisms beyond general equal pay legislation. Policy instruments might include mandatory pay transparency at executive levels, gender quotas for senior positions, and restructuring of tournament-style promotion systems that disadvantage women through excessive hours requirements and geographical mobility demands. The large negative interaction for Public sector managers (-5.449 pp) demonstrates that institutional constraints can effectively compress executive-level gender gaps.

The temporal convergence patterns document consistent progress at 0.17 percentage points per year (2010-2022), suggesting that existing policies and structural changes are gradually reducing gender wage inequality. However, the convergence in 2022 (-1.732 pp from 2010 baseline) may reflect pandemic-induced labor market disruptions that disproportionately affected male-dominated sectors. Long-term monitoring will clarify whether this represents structural change or temporary compositional effects.

\subsection{Limitations and Methodological Caveats}

Despite methodological rigor, several limitations constrain causal interpretation and generalizability. First, the analysis relies on observational data, which are subject to selection bias due to differential labor force participation. While panel methods address time-invariant selection, dynamic selection processes—whereby discrimination affects participation decisions—remain uncontrolled. Heckman selection models prove infeasible given data structure constraints, potentially biasing estimates toward zero if discouraged workers exit labor markets entirely.

Second, \textbf{the absence of individual-level controls represents a critical limitation}. The Structure of Earnings Survey aggregates data at the country-sector-occupation-year level, precluding direct controls for education, work experience, job tenure, or other human capital characteristics that may confound estimated sectoral and occupational effects. While the nine ISCO-08 occupational categories proxy for skill requirements, they cannot capture within-occupation heterogeneity in qualifications or productivity. This limitation means that observed gender pay gaps may partially reflect composition effects—systematic differences in human capital characteristics across sectors and occupations—rather than pure discrimination. The rich occupational classification mitigates but does not eliminate this concern, suggesting that primary estimates represent upper bounds on discriminatory wage differentials, with unknown portions attributable to unobserved productivity differences.

Third, the employer-based sampling frame, while ensuring wage data quality, excludes informal economy employment where gender inequalities may be more pronounced. This exclusion particularly affects Southern and Eastern European countries with larger shadow economies, potentially underestimating true societal-level wage gaps. Additionally, the use of annual earnings without controlling for hours worked means that part-time employment patterns may influence observed gaps. The analysis also neglects other compensation dimensions, including bonuses, stock options, and non-monetary benefits that may exhibit different gender patterns.

Fourth, unobserved productivity heterogeneity remains a fundamental challenge to identification. Despite rich occupational controls, the analysis cannot definitively separate discrimination from productivity differences, particularly for specialized skills or firm-specific human capital. The interpretation of unexplained wage gaps as discrimination thus requires maintained assumptions about productivity distribution conditional on observables—assumptions that remain empirically untestable within current frameworks.

Fifth, the panel structure, with four-year intervals, limits the analysis of short-term dynamics and policy responses. Annual variation in wage gaps, potentially important for understanding business cycle effects or immediate policy impacts, remains unobserved. The relatively short panel dimension (with a maximum of four observations per panel across 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022) further constrains dynamic panel methods and prevents the analysis of long-term career trajectories where cumulative disadvantage processes are at play.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

The findings highlight several promising avenues for advancing research on the gender wage gap. First, \textbf{matched employer-employee data} (LEED) would address the critical limitation of missing individual-level controls identified in this study. Linking workers to firms would enable: (1) direct controls for education, experience, and tenure, (2) within-firm analysis isolating discrimination from sorting effects, (3) tracking of individual career trajectories and cumulative disadvantage processes, and (4) identification of firm-level practices (flexible work arrangements, transparency policies, diversity initiatives) that reduce gender gaps. Such micro-level data would transform this thesis's sectoral-occupational framework into a comprehensive multilevel model spanning individuals, firms, sectors, and countries.

Second, methodologically, the integration of machine learning techniques could enhance the detection of complex interaction patterns and non-linearities that are obscured by parametric specifications. Causal forest algorithms, in particular, offer potential for identifying heterogeneous treatment effects across high-dimensional covariate spaces, revealing targeted intervention opportunities.

Third, substantively, investigating wage gap mechanisms during economic disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the green transition, represents critical research priorities. Preliminary evidence suggests that the adoption of pandemic-induced remote work may fundamentally alter the dynamics of discrimination, while the sectoral reallocation effects of climate policies remain largely unexplored. Longitudinal analysis, which tracks individual workers through these transitions, could illuminate adaptation mechanisms and policy effectiveness.

Fourth, cross-disciplinary integration with behavioral economics and organizational psychology could enrich our understanding of the persistence of discrimination despite economic incentives. Laboratory experiments examining implicit bias in wage-setting, field experiments with hiring interventions, and neuroimaging studies of gender stereotype activation offer complementary insights to econometric analysis. Such triangulation could distinguish taste-based from statistical discrimination while identifying cognitive intervention points.

Fifth, institutionally, the quasi-experimental evaluation of recent policy innovations—including pay transparency mandates, parental leave reforms, and board diversity quotas—provides identification opportunities that are absent in historical data. Staggered implementation across EU member states creates natural experiments amenable to difference-in-differences and synthetic control methodologies. Systematic evaluation could establish causal policy effects while identifying optimal design features.

\subsection{Concluding Remarks}

Gender wage inequality represents not merely an economic inefficiency but a fundamental challenge to social justice and democratic equality within European societies. This thesis contributes robust empirical evidence that discrimination operates through multiple, interacting channels—sectoral institutions, occupational hierarchies, and their contingent combinations—requiring equally multifaceted policy responses. While acknowledging methodological limitations inherent in observational analysis, the findings provide actionable insights for evidence-based interventions.

The documented persistence of substantial wage gaps, despite decades of equal pay legislation, underscores the inadequacy of formal legal frameworks in the absence of complementary institutional reforms. The sectoral and occupational heterogeneity revealed through this analysis suggests that effective equality strategies must move beyond universal mandates toward targeted, context-specific interventions addressing particular discrimination mechanisms. Public sector employment practices, transparent wage structures, and collective bargaining institutions emerge as mechanisms that enhance equality and warrant broader implementation.

Looking forward, achieving substantive gender equality in European labor markets requires accelerated progress beyond current trajectories. The deceleration in gap reduction rates, combined with emerging challenges from technological disruption and economic restructuring, necessitates renewed policy commitment and innovation. This thesis provides an empirical foundation for such efforts, quantifying the magnitudes of discrimination, identifying institutional moderators, and illuminating pathways toward more equitable labor market outcomes.

The ultimate test of this research lies not in statistical significance but in practical significance—whether the insights generated contribute to tangible progress in women's economic equality. As European societies confront demographic transitions, technological transformations, and evolving work arrangements, gender equality represents both an economic imperative for optimal human capital utilization and a moral imperative for social justice. This thesis presents evidence that, while the challenge remains substantial, identifiable, quantifiable, and achievable pathways to progress are evident through sustained, evidence-based policy interventions.
