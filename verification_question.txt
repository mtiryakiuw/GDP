VERIFICATION QUESTION FOR OTHER AI MODELS
==========================================

I have a Panel 2 analysis output file with the following structure:

---
MODEL 1: PRIMARY MODEL (Fixed Effects)
---
This is a Fixed Effects (Within) model with the following output:

```
Oneway (individual) effect Within Model

Call:
plm(formula = gender_pay_gap ~ industry + construction + public_sector + 
    high_skill + managerial + factor(year), data = pdata2, model = "within")

Coefficients:
                 Estimate Std. Error  t-value  Pr(>|t|)    
factor(year)2014 -1.36094    0.20740  -6.5620 5.592e-11 ***
factor(year)2018 -1.01482    0.20435  -4.9662 6.951e-07 ***
factor(year)2022 -2.17274    0.20826 -10.4327 < 2.2e-16 ***
```

---
MODEL 3: INTERACTION MODEL (Random Effects)
---
This is a Random Effects model with interactions:

```
Oneway (individual) effect Random Effect Model 
   (Swamy-Arora's transformation)

Call:
plm(formula = gender_pay_gap ~ industry + construction + public_sector + 
    high_skill + managerial + industry:high_skill + industry:managerial + 
    public_sector:high_skill + public_sector:managerial + factor(year),

QUESTION:
---

In my thesis abstract, I reported these numbers:
- industry: 4.392
- public_sector: -2.706
- high_skill: 2.936
- managerial: 4.663
- industry:high_skill: -4.211
- public_sector:managerial: -1.678
- factor(year)2014: -1.361
- factor(year)2018: -1.015
- factor(year)2022: -2.173

AI Model A says: "These numbers come from TWO DIFFERENT MODELS:
- Main effects (industry, public, high_skill, managerial) come from Model 3 (Interaction/Random Effects)
- Year effects (-1.361, -1.015, -2.173) come from Model 1 (Primary/Fixed Effects)
- This is INCONSISTENT mixing of two models"

AI Model B says: "No, Model A is wrong. All these numbers come from a single 'No Interactions' model.
The numbers 4.392, 2.936, etc. are NOT from the Interaction Model.
In the Primary Model (no interactions), the coefficients are:
- industry: 2.325
- public_sector: -2.785
- high_skill: 2.127
- managerial: 3.813"

WHICH AI MODEL IS CORRECT?

Please carefully examine the output above and tell me:
1. Where do the numbers 4.392, -2.706, 2.936, 4.663 come from?
2. Where do the numbers -1.361, -1.015, -2.173 come from?
3. Is it possible for a Fixed Effects (Within) model to show coefficients for time-invariant variables like industry, public_sector?
4. Did I mix coefficients from two different models, or did I use a single consistent model?

Please provide detailed reasoning with references to the specific model outputs shown above.
